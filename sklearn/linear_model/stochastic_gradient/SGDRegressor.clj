  "Linear model fitted by minimizing a regularized empirical loss with SGD

    SGD stands for Stochastic Gradient Descent: the gradient of the loss is
    estimated each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way with
    a decreasing strength schedule (aka learning rate).

    The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model
    parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared euclidean norm
    L2 or the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net). If the
    parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the
    update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieve
    online feature selection.

    This implementation works with data represented as dense numpy arrays of
    floating point values for the features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    loss : str, default: 'squared_loss'
        The loss function to be used. The possible values are 'squared_loss',
        'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive', or 'squared_epsilon_insensitive'

        The 'squared_loss' refers to the ordinary least squares fit.
        'huber' modifies 'squared_loss' to focus less on getting outliers
        correct by switching from squared to linear loss past a distance of
        epsilon. 'epsilon_insensitive' ignores errors less than epsilon and is
        linear past that; this is the loss function used in SVR.
        'squared_epsilon_insensitive' is the same but becomes squared loss past
        a tolerance of epsilon.

    penalty : str, 'none', 'l2', 'l1', or 'elasticnet'
        The penalty (aka regularization term) to be used. Defaults to 'l2'
        which is the standard regularizer for linear SVM models. 'l1' and
        'elasticnet' might bring sparsity to the model (feature selection)
        not achievable with 'l2'.

    alpha : float
        Constant that multiplies the regularization term. Defaults to 0.0001
        Also used to compute learning_rate when set to 'optimal'.

    l1_ratio : float
        The Elastic Net mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1.
        l1_ratio=0 corresponds to L2 penalty, l1_ratio=1 to L1.
        Defaults to 0.15.

    fit_intercept : bool
        Whether the intercept should be estimated or not. If False, the
        data is assumed to be already centered. Defaults to True.

    max_iter : int, optional (default=1000)
        The maximum number of passes over the training data (aka epochs).
        It only impacts the behavior in the ``fit`` method, and not the
        `partial_fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    tol : float or None, optional (default=1e-3)
        The stopping criterion. If it is not None, the iterations will stop
        when (loss > best_loss - tol) for ``n_iter_no_change`` consecutive
        epochs.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    shuffle : bool, optional
        Whether or not the training data should be shuffled after each epoch.
        Defaults to True.

    verbose : integer, optional
        The verbosity level.

    epsilon : float
        Epsilon in the epsilon-insensitive loss functions; only if `loss` is
        'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive', or 'squared_epsilon_insensitive'.
        For 'huber', determines the threshold at which it becomes less
        important to get the prediction exactly right.
        For epsilon-insensitive, any differences between the current prediction
        and the correct label are ignored if they are less than this threshold.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator to use when shuffling
        the data.  If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number
        generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number
        generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState
        instance used by `np.random`.

    learning_rate : string, optional
        The learning rate schedule:

        'constant':
            eta = eta0
        'optimal':
            eta = 1.0 / (alpha * (t + t0))
            where t0 is chosen by a heuristic proposed by Leon Bottou.
        'invscaling': [default]
            eta = eta0 / pow(t, power_t)
        'adaptive':
            eta = eta0, as long as the training keeps decreasing.
            Each time n_iter_no_change consecutive epochs fail to decrease the
            training loss by tol or fail to increase validation score by tol if
            early_stopping is True, the current learning rate is divided by 5.

    eta0 : double
        The initial learning rate for the 'constant', 'invscaling' or
        'adaptive' schedules. The default value is 0.01.

    power_t : double
        The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate [default 0.5].

    early_stopping : bool, default=False
        Whether to use early stopping to terminate training when validation
        score is not improving. If set to True, it will automatically set aside
        a fraction of training data as validation and terminate
        training when validation score is not improving by at least tol for
        n_iter_no_change consecutive epochs.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    validation_fraction : float, default=0.1
        The proportion of training data to set aside as validation set for
        early stopping. Must be between 0 and 1.
        Only used if early_stopping is True.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    n_iter_no_change : int, default=5
        Number of iterations with no improvement to wait before early stopping.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    warm_start : bool, optional
        When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
        initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.
        See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

        Repeatedly calling fit or partial_fit when warm_start is True can
        result in a different solution than when calling fit a single time
        because of the way the data is shuffled.
        If a dynamic learning rate is used, the learning rate is adapted
        depending on the number of samples already seen. Calling ``fit`` resets
        this counter, while ``partial_fit``  will result in increasing the
        existing counter.

    average : bool or int, optional
        When set to True, computes the averaged SGD weights and stores the
        result in the ``coef_`` attribute. If set to an int greater than 1,
        averaging will begin once the total number of samples seen reaches
        average. So ``average=10`` will begin averaging after seeing 10
        samples.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        Weights assigned to the features.

    intercept_ : array, shape (1,)
        The intercept term.

    average_coef_ : array, shape (n_features,)
        Averaged weights assigned to the features.

    average_intercept_ : array, shape (1,)
        The averaged intercept term.

    n_iter_ : int
        The actual number of iterations to reach the stopping criterion.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn import linear_model
    >>> n_samples, n_features = 10, 5
    >>> rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
    >>> y = rng.randn(n_samples)
    >>> X = rng.randn(n_samples, n_features)
    >>> clf = linear_model.SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3)
    >>> clf.fit(X, y)
    ... #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    SGDRegressor(alpha=0.0001, average=False, early_stopping=False,
           epsilon=0.1, eta0=0.01, fit_intercept=True, l1_ratio=0.15,
           learning_rate='invscaling', loss='squared_loss', max_iter=1000,
           n_iter_no_change=5, penalty='l2', power_t=0.25, random_state=None,

        Notes
        -----
        The R2 score used when calling ``score`` on a regressor will use
        ``multioutput='uniform_average'`` from version 0.23 to keep consistent
        with `metrics.r2_score`. This will influence the ``score`` method of

(defn sparsify 
  "Convert coefficient matrix to sparse format.

        Converts the ``coef_`` member to a scipy.sparse matrix, which for
        L1-regularized models can be much more memory- and storage-efficient
        than the usual numpy.ndarray representation.

        The ``intercept_`` member is not converted.

        Notes
        -----
        For non-sparse models, i.e. when there are not many zeros in ``coef_``,
        this may actually *increase* memory usage, so use this method with
        care. A rule of thumb is that the number of zero elements, which can
        be computed with ``(coef_ == 0).sum()``, must be more than 50% for this
        to provide significant benefits.

        After calling this method, further fitting with the partial_fit
        method (if any) will not work until you call densify.

        Returns
