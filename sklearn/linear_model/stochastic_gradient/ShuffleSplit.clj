(ns sklearn.linear-model.stochastic-gradient.ShuffleSplit
  "Random permutation cross-validator

    Yields indices to split data into training and test sets.

    Note: contrary to other cross-validation strategies, random splits
    do not guarantee that all folds will be different, although this is
    still very likely for sizeable datasets.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default 10
        Number of re-shuffling & splitting iterations.

    test_size : float, int, None, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the test split. If int, represents the
        absolute number of test samples. If None, the value is set to the
        complement of the train size. If ``train_size`` is also None, it will
        be set to 0.1.

    train_size : float, int, or None, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

  "Generate indices to split data into training and test set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples
            and n_features is the number of features.

        y : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            The target variable for supervised learning problems.

        groups : array-like, with shape (n_samples,), optional
            Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into
            train/test set.

        Yields
        ------
        train : ndarray
            The training set indices for that split.

        test : ndarray
            The testing set indices for that split.

        Notes
        -----
        Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
        split. You can make the results identical by setting ``random_state``
        to an integer.
