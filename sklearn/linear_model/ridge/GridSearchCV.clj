(ns sklearn.linear-model.ridge.GridSearchCV
  "Exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator.

    Important members are fit, predict.

    GridSearchCV implements a \"fit\" and a \"score\" method.
    It also implements \"predict\", \"predict_proba\", \"decision_function\",
    \"transform\" and \"inverse_transform\" if they are implemented in the
    estimator used.

    The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized
    by cross-validated grid-search over a parameter grid.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <grid_search>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object.
        This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface.
        Either estimator needs to provide a ``score`` function,
        or ``scoring`` must be passed.

    param_grid : dict or list of dictionaries
        Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and lists of
        parameter settings to try as values, or a list of such
        dictionaries, in which case the grids spanned by each dictionary
        in the list are explored. This enables searching over any sequence
        of parameter settings.

    scoring : string, callable, list/tuple, dict or None, default: None
        A single string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.

        For evaluating multiple metrics, either give a list of (unique) strings
        or a dict with names as keys and callables as values.

        NOTE that when using custom scorers, each scorer should return a single
        value. Metric functions returning a list/array of values can be wrapped
        into multiple scorers that return one value each.

        See :ref:`multimetric_grid_search` for an example.

        If None, the estimator's score method is used.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    iid : boolean, default='warn'
        If True, return the average score across folds, weighted by the number
        of samples in each test set. In this case, the data is assumed to be
        identically distributed across the folds, and the loss minimized is
        the total loss per sample, and not the mean loss across the folds. If
        False, return the average score across folds. Default is True, but
        will change to False in version 0.22, to correspond to the standard
        definition of cross-validation.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            Parameter ``iid`` will change from True to False by default in
            version 0.22, and will be removed in 0.24.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 3-fold cross validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            ``cv`` default value if None will change from 3-fold to 5-fold
            in v0.22.

    refit : boolean, string, or callable, default=True
        Refit an estimator using the best found parameters on the whole
        dataset.

        For multiple metric evaluation, this needs to be a string denoting the
        scorer that would be used to find the best parameters for refitting
        the estimator at the end.

        Where there are considerations other than maximum score in
        choosing a best estimator, ``refit`` can be set to a function which
        returns the selected ``best_index_`` given ``cv_results_``.

        The refitted estimator is made available at the ``best_estimator_``
        attribute and permits using ``predict`` directly on this
        ``GridSearchCV`` instance.

        Also for multiple metric evaluation, the attributes ``best_index_``,
        ``best_score_`` and ``best_params_`` will only be available if
        ``refit`` is set and all of them will be determined w.r.t this specific
        scorer. ``best_score_`` is not returned if refit is callable.

        See ``scoring`` parameter to know more about multiple metric
        evaluation.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            Support for callable added.

    verbose : integer
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    error_score : 'raise' or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error. Default is 'raise' but from
        version 0.22 it will change to np.nan.

    return_train_score : boolean, default=False
        If ``False``, the ``cv_results_`` attribute will not include training
        scores.
        Computing training scores is used to get insights on how different
        parameter settings impact the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.
        However computing the scores on the training set can be computationally
        expensive and is not strictly required to select the parameters that
        yield the best generalization performance.

            'params'             : [{'kernel': 'poly', 'degree': 2}, ...],
            }

        NOTE

        The key ``'params'`` is used to store a list of parameter
        settings dicts for all the parameter candidates.

        The ``mean_fit_time``, ``std_fit_time``, ``mean_score_time`` and
        ``std_score_time`` are all in seconds.

        For multi-metric evaluation, the scores for all the scorers are
        available in the ``cv_results_`` dict at the keys ending with that
        scorer's name (``'_<scorer_name>'``) instead of ``'_score'`` shown
        above. ('split0_test_precision', 'mean_train_precision' etc.)

    best_estimator_ : estimator or dict
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if ``refit=False``.

        See ``refit`` parameter for more information on allowed values.

    best_score_ : float
        Mean cross-validated score of the best_estimator

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    best_index_ : int
        The index (of the ``cv_results_`` arrays) which corresponds to the best
        candidate parameter setting.

        The dict at ``search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]`` gives
        the parameter setting for the best model, that gives the highest
        mean score (``search.best_score_``).

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    scorer_ : function or a dict
        Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
        parameters for the model.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this attribute holds the validated
        ``scoring`` dict which maps the scorer key to the scorer callable.

    n_splits_ : int
        The number of cross-validation splits (folds/iterations).

    refit_time_ : float
        Seconds used for refitting the best model on the whole dataset.

        This is present only if ``refit`` is not False.

    Notes
    -----
    The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the left out
    data, unless an explicit score is passed in which case it is used instead.

    If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
    point in the grid (and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
    reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
    the dataset is large and not enough memory is available.  A workaround in
    this case is to set `pre_dispatch`. Then, the memory is copied only
    `pre_dispatch` many times. A reasonable value for `pre_dispatch` is `2 *
    n_jobs`.

            }

        NOTE

        The key ``'params'`` is used to store a list of parameter
        settings dicts for all the parameter candidates.

        The ``mean_fit_time``, ``std_fit_time``, ``mean_score_time`` and
        ``std_score_time`` are all in seconds.

        For multi-metric evaluation, the scores for all the scorers are
        available in the ``cv_results_`` dict at the keys ending with that
        scorer's name (``'_<scorer_name>'``) instead of ``'_score'`` shown
        above. ('split0_test_precision', 'mean_train_precision' etc.)

    best_estimator_ : estimator or dict
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if ``refit=False``.

        See ``refit`` parameter for more information on allowed values.

    best_score_ : float
        Mean cross-validated score of the best_estimator

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    best_index_ : int
        The index (of the ``cv_results_`` arrays) which corresponds to the best
        candidate parameter setting.

        The dict at ``search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]`` gives
        the parameter setting for the best model, that gives the highest
        mean score (``search.best_score_``).

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    scorer_ : function or a dict
        Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
        parameters for the model.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this attribute holds the validated
        ``scoring`` dict which maps the scorer key to the scorer callable.

    n_splits_ : int
        The number of cross-validation splits (folds/iterations).

    refit_time_ : float
        Seconds used for refitting the best model on the whole dataset.

        This is present only if ``refit`` is not False.

    Notes
    -----
    The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the left out
    data, unless an explicit score is passed in which case it is used instead.

    If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
    point in the grid (and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
    reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
    the dataset is large and not enough memory is available.  A workaround in
    this case is to set `pre_dispatch`. Then, the memory is copied only
    `pre_dispatch` many times. A reasonable value for `pre_dispatch` is `2 *
    n_jobs`.
