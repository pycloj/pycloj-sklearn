(ns sklearn.linear-model.LogisticRegressionCV
  "Logistic Regression CV (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.

    See glossary entry for :term:`cross-validation estimator`.

    This class implements logistic regression using liblinear, newton-cg, sag
    of lbfgs optimizer. The newton-cg, sag and lbfgs solvers support only L2
    regularization with primal formulation. The liblinear solver supports both
    L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty.
    Elastic-Net penalty is only supported by the saga solver.

    For the grid of `Cs` values and `l1_ratios` values, the best
    hyperparameter is selected by the cross-validator `StratifiedKFold`, but
    it can be changed using the `cv` parameter. The 'newton-cg', 'sag',
    'saga' and 'lbfgs' solvers can warm-start the coefficients (see
    :term:`Glossary<warm_start>`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    Cs : list of floats or int, optional (default=10)
        Each of the values in Cs describes the inverse of regularization
        strength. If Cs is as an int, then a grid of Cs values are chosen
        in a logarithmic scale between 1e-4 and 1e4.
        Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger
        regularization.

    fit_intercept : bool, optional (default=True)
        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be
        added to the decision function.

    cv : int or cross-validation generator, optional (default=None)
        The default cross-validation generator used is Stratified K-Folds.
        If an integer is provided, then it is the number of folds used.
        See the module :mod:`sklearn.model_selection` module for the
        list of possible cross-validation objects.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            ``cv`` default value if None will change from 3-fold to 5-fold
            in v0.22.

    dual : bool, optional (default=False)
        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for
        l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when
        n_samples > n_features.

    penalty : str, 'l1', 'l2', or 'elasticnet', optional (default='l2')
        Used to specify the norm used in the penalization. The 'newton-cg',
        'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers support only l2 penalties. 'elasticnet' is
        only supported by the 'saga' solver.

    scoring : string, callable, or None, optional (default=None)
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``. For a list of scoring functions
        that can be used, look at :mod:`sklearn.metrics`. The
        default scoring option used is 'accuracy'.

    solver : str, {'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'sag', 'saga'},              optional (default='lbfgs')

        Algorithm to use in the optimization problem.

        - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag' and
          'saga' are faster for large ones.
        - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'
          handle multinomial loss; 'liblinear' is limited to one-versus-rest
          schemes.
        - 'newton-cg', 'lbfgs' and 'sag' only handle L2 penalty, whereas
          'liblinear' and 'saga' handle L1 penalty.
        - 'liblinear' might be slower in LogisticRegressionCV because it does
          not handle warm-starting.

        Note that 'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on
        features with approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data
        with a scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.
        .. versionadded:: 0.19
           SAGA solver.

    tol : float, optional (default=1e-4)
        Tolerance for stopping criteria.

    max_iter : int, optional (default=100)
        Maximum number of iterations of the optimization algorithm.

    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', optional (default=None)
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.

        The \"balanced\" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.

        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           class_weight == 'balanced'

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Number of CPU cores used during the cross-validation loop.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        For the 'liblinear', 'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers set verbose to any
        positive number for verbosity.

    refit : bool, optional (default=True)
        If set to True, the scores are averaged across all folds, and the
        coefs and the C that corresponds to the best score is taken, and a
        final refit is done using these parameters.
        Otherwise the coefs, intercepts and C that correspond to the
        best scores across folds are averaged.

    intercept_scaling : float, optional (default=1)
        Useful only when the solver 'liblinear' is used
        and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes
        [x, self.intercept_scaling],
        i.e. a \"synthetic\" feature with constant value equal to
        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.
        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.

        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization
        as all other features.
        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight
        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.

    multi_class : str, {'ovr', 'multinomial', 'auto'}, optional (default='ovr')
        If the option chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each
        label. For 'multinomial' the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit
        across the entire probability distribution, *even when the data is
        binary*. 'multinomial' is unavailable when solver='liblinear'.
        'auto' selects 'ovr' if the data is binary, or if solver='liblinear',
        and otherwise selects 'multinomial'.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver for 'multinomial' case.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            Default will change from 'ovr' to 'auto' in 0.22.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    l1_ratios : list of float or None, optional (default=None)
        The list of Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with ``0 <= l1_ratio <= 1``.
        Only used if ``penalty='elasticnet'``. A value of 0 is equivalent to
        using ``penalty='l2'``, while 1 is equivalent to using
        ``penalty='l1'``. For ``0 < l1_ratio <1``, the penalty is a combination
        of L1 and L2.

    Attributes
    ----------
    classes_ : array, shape (n_classes, )
        A list of class labels known to the classifier.

    coef_ : array, shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)

        `coef_` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem
        is binary.

    intercept_ : array, shape (1,) or (n_classes,)
        Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.

        If `fit_intercept` is set to False, the intercept is set to zero.
        `intercept_` is of shape(1,) when the problem is binary.

    Cs_ : array, shape (n_cs)
        Array of C i.e. inverse of regularization parameter values used
        for cross-validation.

    l1_ratios_ : array, shape (n_l1_ratios)
        Array of l1_ratios used for cross-validation. If no l1_ratio is used
        (i.e. penalty is not 'elasticnet'), this is set to ``[None]``

    coefs_paths_ : array, shape (n_folds, n_cs, n_features) or                    (n_folds, n_cs, n_features + 1)
        dict with classes as the keys, and the path of coefficients obtained
        during cross-validating across each fold and then across each Cs
        after doing an OvR for the corresponding class as values.
        If the 'multi_class' option is set to 'multinomial', then
        the coefs_paths are the coefficients corresponding to each class.
        Each dict value has shape ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_features)`` or
        ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_features + 1)`` depending on whether the
        intercept is fit or not. If ``penalty='elasticnet'``, the shape is
        ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios_, n_features)`` or
        ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios_, n_features + 1)``.

    scores_ : dict
        dict with classes as the keys, and the values as the
        grid of scores obtained during cross-validating each fold, after doing
        an OvR for the corresponding class. If the 'multi_class' option
        given is 'multinomial' then the same scores are repeated across
        all classes, since this is the multinomial class. Each dict value
        has shape ``(n_folds, n_cs`` or ``(n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios)`` if
        ``penalty='elasticnet'``.

    C_ : array, shape (n_classes,) or (n_classes - 1,)
        Array of C that maps to the best scores across every class. If refit is

    l1_ratio_ : array, shape (n_classes,) or (n_classes - 1,)
        Array of l1_ratio that maps to the best scores across every class. If
        refit is set to False, then for each class, the best l1_ratio is the
        average of the l1_ratio's that correspond to the best scores for each
        fold.  `l1_ratio_` is of shape(n_classes,) when the problem is binary.

    n_iter_ : array, shape (n_classes, n_folds, n_cs) or (1, n_folds, n_cs)
        Actual number of iterations for all classes, folds and Cs.
        In the binary or multinomial cases, the first dimension is equal to 1.
        If ``penalty='elasticnet'``, the shape is ``(n_classes, n_folds,
        n_cs, n_l1_ratios)`` or ``(1, n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios)``.

        The \"balanced\" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.

        for more details.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        For the 'liblinear', 'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers set verbose to any
        positive number for verbosity.

        If set to True, the scores are averaged across all folds, and the
        coefs and the C that corresponds to the best score is taken, and a

        Otherwise the coefs, intercepts and C that correspond to the

    intercept_scaling : float, optional (default=1)
        Useful only when the solver 'liblinear' is used
        and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes

        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.

        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization

        using ``penalty='l2'``, while 1 is equivalent to using
        ``penalty='l1'``. For ``0 < l1_ratio <1``, the penalty is a combination

        refit is set to False, then for each class, the best l1_ratio is the
        average of the l1_ratio's that correspond to the best scores for each
        fold.  `l1_ratio_` is of shape(n_classes,) when the problem is binary.

    n_iter_ : array, shape (n_classes, n_folds, n_cs) or (1, n_folds, n_cs)
        Actual number of iterations for all classes, folds and Cs.
        In the binary or multinomial cases, the first dimension is equal to 1.
        If ``penalty='elasticnet'``, the shape is ``(n_classes, n_folds,
        n_cs, n_l1_ratios)`` or ``(1, n_folds, n_cs, n_l1_ratios)``.

(defn densify 
  "Convert coefficient matrix to dense array format.

        Converts the ``coef_`` member (back) to a numpy.ndarray. This is the
        default format of ``coef_`` and is required for fitting, so calling
        this method is only required on models that have previously been

(defn predict-proba

        The returned estimates for all classes are ordered by the

        For a multi_class problem, if multi_class is set to be \"multinomial\"
        the softmax function is used to find the predicted probability of
        each class.

(defn sparsify 
  "Convert coefficient matrix to sparse format.

        Converts the ``coef_`` member to a scipy.sparse matrix, which for
        L1-regularized models can be much more memory- and storage-efficient
        than the usual numpy.ndarray representation.

        The ``intercept_`` member is not converted.

        Notes
        -----
        For non-sparse models, i.e. when there are not many zeros in ``coef_``,
        this may actually *increase* memory usage, so use this method with
        care. A rule of thumb is that the number of zero elements, which can
        be computed with ``(coef_ == 0).sum()``, must be more than 50% for this
        to provide significant benefits.

        After calling this method, further fitting with the partial_fit
        method (if any) will not work until you call densify.

        -------
