(ns sklearn.linear-model.LassoLars
  "Lasso model fit with Least Angle Regression a.k.a. Lars

    It is a Linear Model trained with an L1 prior as regularizer.

    The optimization objective for Lasso is::

    (1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <least_angle_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float
        Constant that multiplies the penalty term. Defaults to 1.0.
        ``alpha = 0`` is equivalent to an ordinary least square, solved
        by :class:`LinearRegression`. For numerical reasons, using
        ``alpha = 0`` with the LassoLars object is not advised and you
        should prefer the LinearRegression object.

    fit_intercept : boolean
        whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (e.g. data is expected to be already centered).

    verbose : boolean or integer, optional
        Sets the verbosity amount

    normalize : boolean, optional, default True
        This parameter is ignored when ``fit_intercept`` is set to False.
        If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by
        subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm.
        If you wish to standardize, please use
        :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` before calling ``fit``
        on an estimator with ``normalize=False``.

    precompute : True | False | 'auto' | array-like
        Whether to use a precomputed Gram matrix to speed up
        calculations. If set to ``'auto'`` let us decide. The Gram
        matrix can also be passed as argument.

    max_iter : integer, optional
        Maximum number of iterations to perform.

    eps : float, optional
        The machine-precision regularization in the computation of the
        Cholesky diagonal factors. Increase this for very ill-conditioned
        systems. Unlike the ``tol`` parameter in some iterative
        optimization-based algorithms, this parameter does not control
        the tolerance of the optimization.

    copy_X : boolean, optional, default True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    fit_path : boolean
        If ``True`` the full path is stored in the ``coef_path_`` attribute.
        If you compute the solution for a large problem or many targets,
        setting ``fit_path`` to ``False`` will lead to a speedup, especially
        with a small alpha.

    positive : boolean (default=False)
        Restrict coefficients to be >= 0. Be aware that you might want to
        remove fit_intercept which is set True by default.
        Under the positive restriction the model coefficients will not converge
        to the ordinary-least-squares solution for small values of alpha.
        Only coefficients up to the smallest alpha value (``alphas_[alphas_ >
        0.].min()`` when fit_path=True) reached by the stepwise Lars-Lasso
        algorithm are typically in congruence with the solution of the
        coordinate descent Lasso estimator.

    Attributes
    ----------
    alphas_ : array, shape (n_alphas + 1,) | list of n_targets such arrays
        Maximum of covariances (in absolute value) at each iteration.         ``n_alphas`` is either ``max_iter``, ``n_features``, or the number of         nodes in the path with correlation greater than ``alpha``, whichever         is smaller.

    active_ : list, length = n_alphas | list of n_targets such lists
        Indices of active variables at the end of the path.

    coef_path_ : array, shape (n_features, n_alphas + 1) or list
        If a list is passed it's expected to be one of n_targets such arrays.
        The varying values of the coefficients along the path. It is not
        present if the ``fit_path`` parameter is ``False``.

    coef_ : array, shape (n_features,) or (n_targets, n_features)
        Parameter vector (w in the formulation formula).

    intercept_ : float | array, shape (n_targets,)
        Independent term in decision function.

    n_iter_ : array-like or int.
        The number of iterations taken by lars_path to find the
        grid of alphas for each target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn import linear_model
    >>> reg = linear_model.LassoLars(alpha=0.01)
    >>> reg.fit([[-1, 1], [0, 0], [1, 1]], [-1, 0, -1])
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    LassoLars(alpha=0.01, copy_X=True, eps=..., fit_intercept=True,
         fit_path=True, max_iter=500, normalize=True, positive=False,
         precompute='auto', verbose=False)
    >>> print(reg.coef_) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

(defn score 
  "Returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction.

        The coefficient R^2 is defined as (1 - u/v), where u is the residual

        sum of squares ((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum().
        The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the
        model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always
        predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features,
        would get a R^2 score of 0.0.

        ----------
        X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)
            Test samples. For some estimators this may be a

        Notes
        -----
        The R2 score used when calling ``score`` on a regressor will use
        ``multioutput='uniform_average'`` from version 0.23 to keep consistent
        with `metrics.r2_score`. This will influence the ``score`` method of
        all the multioutput regressors (except for
        `multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor`). To specify the default value
        manually and avoid the warning, please either call `metrics.r2_score`
        directly or make a custom scorer with `metrics.make_scorer` (the
        built-in scorer ``'r2'`` uses ``multioutput='uniform_average'``).
