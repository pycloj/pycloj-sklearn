(ns sklearn.linear-model.theil-sen.TheilSenRegressor
  "Theil-Sen Estimator: robust multivariate regression model.

    The algorithm calculates least square solutions on subsets with size
    n_subsamples of the samples in X. Any value of n_subsamples between the
    number of features and samples leads to an estimator with a compromise
    between robustness and efficiency. Since the number of least square
    solutions is \"n_samples choose n_subsamples\", it can be extremely large
    and can therefore be limited with max_subpopulation. If this limit is
    reached, the subsets are chosen randomly. In a final step, the spatial
    median (or L1 median) is calculated of all least square solutions.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <theil_sen_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit_intercept : boolean, optional, default True
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations.

    copy_X : boolean, optional, default True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    max_subpopulation : int, optional, default 1e4
        Instead of computing with a set of cardinality 'n choose k', where n is
        the number of samples and k is the number of subsamples (at least
        number of features), consider only a stochastic subpopulation of a
        given maximal size if 'n choose k' is larger than max_subpopulation.
        For other than small problem sizes this parameter will determine
        memory usage and runtime if n_subsamples is not changed.

    n_subsamples : int, optional, default None
        Number of samples to calculate the parameters. This is at least the
        number of features (plus 1 if fit_intercept=True) and the number of
        samples as a maximum. A lower number leads to a higher breakdown
        point and a low efficiency while a high number leads to a low
        breakdown point and a high efficiency. If None, take the
        minimum number of subsamples leading to maximal robustness.
        If n_subsamples is set to n_samples, Theil-Sen is identical to least
        squares.

    max_iter : int, optional, default 300
        Maximum number of iterations for the calculation of spatial median.

    tol : float, optional, default 1.e-3
        Tolerance when calculating spatial median.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default None
        A random number generator instance to define the state of the random
        permutations generator.  If int, random_state is the seed used by the
        random number generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the
        random number generator; If None, the random number generator is the
        RandomState instance used by `np.random`.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Number of CPUs to use during the cross validation.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : boolean, optional, default False
        Verbose mode when fitting the model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array, shape = (n_features)
        Coefficients of the regression model (median of distribution).

    intercept_ : float
        Estimated intercept of regression model.

    breakdown_ : float
        Approximated breakdown point.

    n_iter_ : int
        Number of iterations needed for the spatial median.

    n_subpopulation_ : int
        Number of combinations taken into account from 'n choose k', where n is
        the number of samples and k is the number of subsamples.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import TheilSenRegressor
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    >>> X, y = make_regression(
    ...     n_samples=200, n_features=2, noise=4.0, random_state=0)
    >>> reg = TheilSenRegressor(random_state=0).fit(X, y)
    >>> reg.score(X, y) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    0.9884...
    >>> reg.predict(X[:1,])
    array([-31.5871...])

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array_like or sparse matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Samples.

(defn score 
  "Returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction.

        The coefficient R^2 is defined as (1 - u/v), where u is the residual
        sum of squares ((y_true - y_pred) ** 2).sum() and v is the total
        sum of squares ((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum().
        The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the
        model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always
        predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features,
        would get a R^2 score of 0.0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)
            Test samples. For some estimators this may be a
            precomputed kernel matrix instead, shape = (n_samples,
            n_samples_fitted], where n_samples_fitted is the number of
            samples used in the fitting for the estimator.

        y : array-like, shape = (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
            True values for X.

        Notes
        -----
        The R2 score used when calling ``score`` on a regressor will use
        ``multioutput='uniform_average'`` from version 0.23 to keep consistent
        with `metrics.r2_score`. This will influence the ``score`` method of
        all the multioutput regressors (except for
        `multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor`). To specify the default value
        manually and avoid the warning, please either call `metrics.r2_score`
        directly or make a custom scorer with `metrics.make_scorer` (the
        built-in scorer ``'r2'`` uses ``multioutput='uniform_average'``).
