(ns sklearn.linear-model.RidgeClassifier
  "Classifier using Ridge regression.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <ridge_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float
        Regularization strength; must be a positive float. Regularization
        improves the conditioning of the problem and reduces the variance of
        the estimates. Larger values specify stronger regularization.
        Alpha corresponds to ``C^-1`` in other linear models such as
        LogisticRegression or LinearSVC.

    fit_intercept : boolean
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set to false, no
        intercept will be used in calculations (e.g. data is expected to be
        already centered).

    normalize : boolean, optional, default False
        This parameter is ignored when ``fit_intercept`` is set to False.
        If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by
        subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm.
        If you wish to standardize, please use
        :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` before calling ``fit``
        on an estimator with ``normalize=False``.

    copy_X : boolean, optional, default True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations for conjugate gradient solver.
        The default value is determined by scipy.sparse.linalg.

    tol : float
        Precision of the solution.

    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', optional
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.

        The \"balanced\" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

    solver : {'auto', 'svd', 'cholesky', 'lsqr', 'sparse_cg', 'sag', 'saga'}
        Solver to use in the computational routines:

        - 'auto' chooses the solver automatically based on the type of data.

        - 'svd' uses a Singular Value Decomposition of X to compute the Ridge
          coefficients. More stable for singular matrices than
          'cholesky'.

        - 'cholesky' uses the standard scipy.linalg.solve function to
          obtain a closed-form solution.

        - 'sparse_cg' uses the conjugate gradient solver as found in
          scipy.sparse.linalg.cg. As an iterative algorithm, this solver is
          more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data
          (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).

        - 'lsqr' uses the dedicated regularized least-squares routine
          scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr. It is the fastest and uses an iterative
          procedure.

        - 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses
          its unbiased and more flexible version named SAGA. Both methods
          use an iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers
          when both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and
          'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with
          approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a
          scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.

          .. versionadded:: 0.17
             Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.
          .. versionadded:: 0.19
           SAGA solver.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator to use when shuffling
        the data.  If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number
        generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number
        generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState
        instance used by `np.random`. Used when ``solver`` == 'sag'.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array, shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)
        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.

        ``coef_`` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem is binary.

    intercept_ : float | array, shape = (n_targets,)
        Independent term in decision function. Set to 0.0 if
        ``fit_intercept = False``.

    n_iter_ : array or None, shape (n_targets,)
        Actual number of iterations for each target. Available only for
        sag and lsqr solvers. Other solvers will return None.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifier
    >>> X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
    >>> clf = RidgeClassifier().fit(X, y)
    >>> clf.score(X, y) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    0.9595...

    Notes
    -----
    For multi-class classification, n_class classifiers are trained in
    a one-versus-all approach. Concretely, this is implemented by taking
    advantage of the multi-variate response support in Ridge.
