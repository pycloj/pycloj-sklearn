  "RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm.

    RANSAC is an iterative algorithm for the robust estimation of parameters
    from a subset of inliers from the complete data set. More information can
    be found in the general documentation of linear models.

    A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in the documentation
    of the ``linear_model`` sub-package.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <ransac_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_estimator : object, optional
        Base estimator object which implements the following methods:

         * `fit(X, y)`: Fit model to given training data and target values.
         * `score(X, y)`: Returns the mean accuracy on the given test data,
           which is used for the stop criterion defined by `stop_score`.
           Additionally, the score is used to decide which of two equally
           large consensus sets is chosen as the better one.
         * `predict(X)`: Returns predicted values using the linear model,
           which is used to compute residual error using loss function.

        If `base_estimator` is None, then
        ``base_estimator=sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()`` is used for
        target values of dtype float.

        Note that the current implementation only supports regression
        estimators.

    min_samples : int (>= 1) or float ([0, 1]), optional
        Minimum number of samples chosen randomly from original data. Treated
        as an absolute number of samples for `min_samples >= 1`, treated as a
        relative number `ceil(min_samples * X.shape[0]`) for
        `min_samples < 1`. This is typically chosen as the minimal number of
        samples necessary to estimate the given `base_estimator`. By default a
        ``sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()`` estimator is assumed and
        `min_samples` is chosen as ``X.shape[1] + 1``.

    residual_threshold : float, optional
        Maximum residual for a data sample to be classified as an inlier.
        By default the threshold is chosen as the MAD (median absolute
        deviation) of the target values `y`.

    is_data_valid : callable, optional
        This function is called with the randomly selected data before the
        model is fitted to it: `is_data_valid(X, y)`. If its return value is
        False the current randomly chosen sub-sample is skipped.

    is_model_valid : callable, optional
        This function is called with the estimated model and the randomly
        selected data: `is_model_valid(model, X, y)`. If its return value is
        False the current randomly chosen sub-sample is skipped.
        Rejecting samples with this function is computationally costlier than
        with `is_data_valid`. `is_model_valid` should therefore only be used if
        the estimated model is needed for making the rejection decision.

    max_trials : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations for random sample selection.

    max_skips : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations that can be skipped due to finding zero
        inliers or invalid data defined by ``is_data_valid`` or invalid models
        defined by ``is_model_valid``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    stop_n_inliers : int, optional
        Stop iteration if at least this number of inliers are found.

    stop_score : float, optional
        Stop iteration if score is greater equal than this threshold.

    stop_probability : float in range [0, 1], optional
        RANSAC iteration stops if at least one outlier-free set of the training
        data is sampled in RANSAC. This requires to generate at least N
        samples (iterations)::

            N >= log(1 - probability) / log(1 - e**m)

        where the probability (confidence) is typically set to high value such
        as 0.99 (the default) and e is the current fraction of inliers w.r.t.
        the total number of samples.

    loss : string, callable, optional, default \"absolute_loss\"
        String inputs, \"absolute_loss\" and \"squared_loss\" are supported which
        find the absolute loss and squared loss per sample
        respectively.

        If ``loss`` is a callable, then it should be a function that takes
        two arrays as inputs, the true and predicted value and returns a 1-D
        array with the i-th value of the array corresponding to the loss
        on ``X[i]``.

        If the loss on a sample is greater than the ``residual_threshold``,
        then this sample is classified as an outlier.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default None
        The generator used to initialize the centers.  If int, random_state is
        the seed used by the random number generator; If RandomState instance,
        random_state is the random number generator; If None, the random number
        generator is the RandomState instance used by `np.random`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimator_ : object
        Best fitted model (copy of the `base_estimator` object).

    n_trials_ : int
        Number of random selection trials until one of the stop criteria is
        met. It is always ``<= max_trials``.

    inlier_mask_ : bool array of shape [n_samples]
        Boolean mask of inliers classified as ``True``.

    n_skips_no_inliers_ : int
        Number of iterations skipped due to finding zero inliers.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    n_skips_invalid_data_ : int
        Number of iterations skipped due to invalid data defined by
        ``is_data_valid``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    n_skips_invalid_model_ : int
        Number of iterations skipped due to an invalid model defined by
        ``is_model_valid``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    >>> X, y = make_regression(
    ...     n_samples=200, n_features=2, noise=4.0, random_state=0)
