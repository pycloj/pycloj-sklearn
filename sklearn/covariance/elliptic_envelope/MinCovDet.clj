  "Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD): robust estimator of covariance.

    The Minimum Covariance Determinant covariance estimator is to be applied
    on Gaussian-distributed data, but could still be relevant on data
    drawn from a unimodal, symmetric distribution. It is not meant to be used
    with multi-modal data (the algorithm used to fit a MinCovDet object is
    likely to fail in such a case).
    One should consider projection pursuit methods to deal with multi-modal
    datasets.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <robust_covariance>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    store_precision : bool
        Specify if the estimated precision is stored.

    assume_centered : bool
        If True, the support of the robust location and the covariance
        estimates is computed, and a covariance estimate is recomputed from
        it, without centering the data.
        Useful to work with data whose mean is significantly equal to
        zero but is not exactly zero.
        If False, the robust location and covariance are directly computed
        with the FastMCD algorithm without additional treatment.

    support_fraction : float, 0 < support_fraction < 1
        The proportion of points to be included in the support of the raw
        MCD estimate. Default is None, which implies that the minimum
        value of support_fraction will be used within the algorithm:
        [n_sample + n_features + 1] / 2

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    raw_covariance_ : array-like, shape (n_features, n_features)
        The raw robust estimated covariance before correction and re-weighting.

    raw_support_ : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
        A mask of the observations that have been used to compute
        the raw robust estimates of location and shape, before correction
        and re-weighting.

    location_ : array-like, shape (n_features,)
        Estimated robust location

    covariance_ : array-like, shape (n_features, n_features)
        Estimated robust covariance matrix

    precision_ : array-like, shape (n_features, n_features)
        Estimated pseudo inverse matrix.
        (stored only if store_precision is True)

    support_ : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
        A mask of the observations that have been used to compute
        the robust estimates of location and shape.

    dist_ : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
        Mahalanobis distances of the training set (on which `fit` is called)
        observations.

    >>> from sklearn.covariance import MinCovDet
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_gaussian_quantiles
    >>> real_cov = np.array([[.8, .3],

    ...                                   size=500)
