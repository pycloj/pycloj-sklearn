(ns sklearn.feature-extraction.text.TfidfTransformer
  "Transform a count matrix to a normalized tf or tf-idf representation

    Tf means term-frequency while tf-idf means term-frequency times inverse
    document-frequency. This is a common term weighting scheme in information
    retrieval, that has also found good use in document classification.

    The goal of using tf-idf instead of the raw frequencies of occurrence of a
    token in a given document is to scale down the impact of tokens that occur
    very frequently in a given corpus and that are hence empirically less
    informative than features that occur in a small fraction of the training
    corpus.

    The formula that is used to compute the tf-idf for a term t of a document d
    in a document set is tf-idf(t, d) = tf(t, d) * idf(t), and the idf is
    computed as idf(t) = log [ n / df(t) ] + 1 (if ``smooth_idf=False``), where
    n is the total number of documents in the document set and df(t) is the
    document frequency of t; the document frequency is the number of documents
    in the document set that contain the term t. The effect of adding \"1\" to
    the idf in the equation above is that terms with zero idf, i.e., terms
    that occur in all documents in a training set, will not be entirely
    ignored.
    (Note that the idf formula above differs from the standard textbook
    notation that defines the idf as
    idf(t) = log [ n / (df(t) + 1) ]).

    If ``smooth_idf=True`` (the default), the constant \"1\" is added to the
    numerator and denominator of the idf as if an extra document was seen
    containing every term in the collection exactly once, which prevents
    zero divisions: idf(d, t) = log [ (1 + n) / (1 + df(d, t)) ] + 1.

    Furthermore, the formulas used to compute tf and idf depend
    on parameter settings that correspond to the SMART notation used in IR
    as follows:

    Tf is \"n\" (natural) by default, \"l\" (logarithmic) when
    ``sublinear_tf=True``.
    Idf is \"t\" when use_idf is given, \"n\" (none) otherwise.
    Normalization is \"c\" (cosine) when ``norm='l2'``, \"n\" (none)
    when ``norm=None``.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <text_feature_extraction>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    norm : 'l1', 'l2' or None, optional (default='l2')
        Each output row will have unit norm, either:
        * 'l2': Sum of squares of vector elements is 1. The cosine
        similarity between two vectors is their dot product when l2 norm has
        been applied.
        * 'l1': Sum of absolute values of vector elements is 1.
        See :func:`preprocessing.normalize`

    use_idf : boolean (default=True)
        Enable inverse-document-frequency reweighting.

    smooth_idf : boolean (default=True)
        Smooth idf weights by adding one to document frequencies, as if an
        extra document was seen containing every term in the collection
        exactly once. Prevents zero divisions.

    sublinear_tf : boolean (default=False)
        Apply sublinear tf scaling, i.e. replace tf with 1 + log(tf).

    Attributes
    ----------
    idf_ : array, shape (n_features)
        The inverse document frequency (IDF) vector; only defined
        if  ``use_idf`` is True.
