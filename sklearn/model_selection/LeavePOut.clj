(ns sklearn.model-selection.LeavePOut
  "Leave-P-Out cross-validator

    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. This results
    in testing on all distinct samples of size p, while the remaining n - p
    samples form the training set in each iteration.

    Note: ``LeavePOut(p)`` is NOT equivalent to
    ``KFold(n_splits=n_samples // p)`` which creates non-overlapping test sets.

    Due to the high number of iterations which grows combinatorically with the
    number of samples this cross-validation method can be very costly. For
    large datasets one should favor :class:`KFold`, :class:`StratifiedKFold`
    or :class:`ShuffleSplit`.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : int
        Size of the test sets. Must be strictly greater than the number of
        samples.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import LeavePOut
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> lpo = LeavePOut(2)
    >>> lpo.get_n_splits(X)
    6
    >>> print(lpo)
    LeavePOut(p=2)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in lpo.split(X):
    ...    print(\"TRAIN:\", train_index, \"TEST:\", test_index)
    ...    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
