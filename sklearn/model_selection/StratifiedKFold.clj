(ns sklearn.model-selection.StratifiedKFold
  "Stratified K-Folds cross-validator

    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets.

    This cross-validation object is a variation of KFold that returns
    stratified folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of
    samples for each class.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=3
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            ``n_splits`` default value will change from 3 to 5 in v0.22.

    shuffle : boolean, optional
        Whether to shuffle each class's samples before splitting into batches.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default=None
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`. Used when ``shuffle`` == True.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
    >>> skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=2)
    >>> skf.get_n_splits(X, y)
    2
    >>> print(skf)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    StratifiedKFold(n_splits=2, random_state=None, shuffle=False)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in skf.split(X, y):
    ...    print(\"TRAIN:\", train_index, \"TEST:\", test_index)
    ...    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    TRAIN: [1 3] TEST: [0 2]
    TRAIN: [0 2] TEST: [1 3]

    Notes
    -----
    Train and test sizes may be different in each fold, with a difference of at
    most ``n_classes``.

(defn get-n-splits

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : object

        y : object
            Always ignored, exists for compatibility.

        n_splits : int
            Returns the number of splitting iterations in the cross-validator.

(defn split 
  "Generate indices to split data into training and test set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples
            and n_features is the number of features.

            Note that providing ``y`` is sufficient to generate the splits and
            hence ``np.zeros(n_samples)`` may be used as a placeholder for
            ``X`` instead of actual training data.

        y : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            The target variable for supervised learning problems.
            Stratification is done based on the y labels.

        groups : object
            Always ignored, exists for compatibility.

        Yields
        ------
        train : ndarray
            The training set indices for that split.

        test : ndarray
            The testing set indices for that split.

        Notes
        -----
        Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
        split. You can make the results identical by setting ``random_state``
        to an integer.
