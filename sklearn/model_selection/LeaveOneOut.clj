(ns sklearn.model-selection.LeaveOneOut
  "Leave-One-Out cross-validator

    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. Each
    sample is used once as a test set (singleton) while the remaining
    samples form the training set.

    Note: ``LeaveOneOut()`` is equivalent to ``KFold(n_splits=n)`` and
    ``LeavePOut(p=1)`` where ``n`` is the number of samples.

    Due to the high number of test sets (which is the same as the
    number of samples) this cross-validation method can be very costly.
    For large datasets one should favor :class:`KFold`, :class:`ShuffleSplit`
    or :class:`StratifiedKFold`.
