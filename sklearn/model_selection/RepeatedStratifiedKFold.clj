(ns sklearn.model-selection.RepeatedStratifiedKFold
  "Repeated Stratified K-Fold cross validator.

    Repeats Stratified K-Fold n times with different randomization in each
    repetition.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

    n_repeats : int, default=10
        Number of times cross-validator needs to be repeated.

    random_state : None, int or RandomState, default=None
        Random state to be used to generate random state for each
        repetition.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedStratifiedKFold
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
    >>> rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=2, n_repeats=2,
    ...     random_state=36851234)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in rskf.split(X, y):
    ...     print(\"TRAIN:\", train_index, \"TEST:\", test_index)
    ...     X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...     y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    ...
    TRAIN: [1 2] TEST: [0 3]
    TRAIN: [0 3] TEST: [1 2]
    TRAIN: [1 3] TEST: [0 2]
    TRAIN: [0 2] TEST: [1 3]

    Notes
    -----
    Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
    split. You can make the results identical by setting ``random_state``
    to an integer.
