(ns sklearn.model-selection.TimeSeriesSplit
  "Time Series cross-validator

    Provides train/test indices to split time series data samples
    that are observed at fixed time intervals, in train/test sets.
    In each split, test indices must be higher than before, and thus shuffling
    in cross validator is inappropriate.

    This cross-validation object is a variation of :class:`KFold`.
    In the kth split, it returns first k folds as train set and the
    (k+1)th fold as test set.

    Note that unlike standard cross-validation methods, successive
    training sets are supersets of those that come before them.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=3
        Number of splits. Must be at least 2.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            ``n_splits`` default value will change from 3 to 5 in v0.22.

    max_train_size : int, optional
        Maximum size for a single training set.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
    >>> print(tscv)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    TimeSeriesSplit(max_train_size=None, n_splits=5)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X):
    ...    print(\"TRAIN:\", train_index, \"TEST:\", test_index)
    ...    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    TRAIN: [0] TEST: [1]
    TRAIN: [0 1] TEST: [2]
    TRAIN: [0 1 2] TEST: [3]
    TRAIN: [0 1 2 3] TEST: [4]
    TRAIN: [0 1 2 3 4] TEST: [5]

    Notes
    -----
    The training set has size ``i * n_samples // (n_splits + 1)
    + n_samples % (n_splits + 1)`` in the ``i``th split,
    with a test set of size ``n_samples//(n_splits + 1)``,
    where ``n_samples`` is the number of samples.
