(ns sklearn.model-selection.RepeatedKFold
  "Repeated K-Fold cross validator.

    Repeats K-Fold n times with different randomization in each repetition.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

    n_repeats : int, default=10
        Number of times cross-validator needs to be repeated.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default=None
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
    >>> rkf = RepeatedKFold(n_splits=2, n_repeats=2, random_state=2652124)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in rkf.split(X):
    ...     print(\"TRAIN:\", train_index, \"TEST:\", test_index)
    ...     X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...     y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    ...
    TRAIN: [0 1] TEST: [2 3]
    TRAIN: [2 3] TEST: [0 1]
    TRAIN: [1 2] TEST: [0 3]
    TRAIN: [0 3] TEST: [1 2]

    Notes
    -----
    Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
    split. You can make the results identical by setting ``random_state``
    to an integer.
