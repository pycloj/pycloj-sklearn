(ns sklearn.model-selection.KFold
  "K-Folds cross-validator

    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. Split
    dataset into k consecutive folds (without shuffling by default).

    Each fold is then used once as a validation while the k - 1 remaining
    folds form the training set.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=3
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            ``n_splits`` default value will change from 3 to 5 in v0.22.

    shuffle : boolean, optional
        Whether to shuffle the data before splitting into batches.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default=None
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`. Used when ``shuffle`` == True.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> kf = KFold(n_splits=2)
    >>> kf.get_n_splits(X)
    2
    >>> print(kf)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    KFold(n_splits=2, random_state=None, shuffle=False)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
    ...    print(\"TRAIN:\", train_index, \"TEST:\", test_index)
    ...    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    TRAIN: [2 3] TEST: [0 1]
    TRAIN: [0 1] TEST: [2 3]

    Notes
    -----
    The first ``n_samples % n_splits`` folds have size
    ``n_samples // n_splits + 1``, other folds have size
    ``n_samples // n_splits``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of samples.

    Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
    split. You can make the results identical by setting ``random_state``
    to an integer.

    --------
    StratifiedKFold
        Takes group information into account to avoid building folds with
        imbalanced class distributions (for binary or multiclass
        classification tasks).

    GroupKFold: K-fold iterator variant with non-overlapping groups.

    RepeatedKFold: Repeats K-Fold n times.

(defn KFold 
  "K-Folds cross-validator

    Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. Split
    dataset into k consecutive folds (without shuffling by default).

    Each fold is then used once as a validation while the k - 1 remaining
    folds form the training set.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=3
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
            ``n_splits`` default value will change from 3 to 5 in v0.22.

    shuffle : boolean, optional
        Whether to shuffle the data before splitting into batches.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default=None
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`. Used when ``shuffle`` == True.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> kf = KFold(n_splits=2)
    >>> kf.get_n_splits(X)
    2
    >>> print(kf)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    KFold(n_splits=2, random_state=None, shuffle=False)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
    ...    print(\"TRAIN:\", train_index, \"TEST:\", test_index)

    TRAIN: [2 3] TEST: [0 1]
    TRAIN: [0 1] TEST: [2 3]

    Notes
    -----
    The first ``n_samples % n_splits`` folds have size
    ``n_samples // n_splits + 1``, other folds have size
    ``n_samples // n_splits``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of samples.
