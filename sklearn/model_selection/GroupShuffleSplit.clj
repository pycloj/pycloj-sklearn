(ns sklearn.model-selection.GroupShuffleSplit
  "Shuffle-Group(s)-Out cross-validation iterator

    Provides randomized train/test indices to split data according to a
    third-party provided group. This group information can be used to encode
    arbitrary domain specific stratifications of the samples as integers.

    For instance the groups could be the year of collection of the samples
    and thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits.

    The difference between LeavePGroupsOut and GroupShuffleSplit is that
    the former generates splits using all subsets of size ``p`` unique groups,
    whereas GroupShuffleSplit generates a user-determined number of random
    test splits, each with a user-determined fraction of unique groups.

    For example, a less computationally intensive alternative to
    ``LeavePGroupsOut(p=10)`` would be
    ``GroupShuffleSplit(test_size=10, n_splits=100)``.

    Note: The parameters ``test_size`` and ``train_size`` refer to groups, and
    not to samples, as in ShuffleSplit.


    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int (default 5)
        Number of re-shuffling & splitting iterations.

    test_size : float, int, None, optional (default=None)
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the test split. If int, represents the
        absolute number of test groups. If None, the value is set to the
        complement of the train size. If ``train_size`` is also None, it will
        be set to 0.2.

    train_size : float, int, or None, default is None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the groups to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train groups. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

(defn split 
  "Generate indices to split data into training and test set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples
            and n_features is the number of features.

        y : array-like, shape (n_samples,), optional
            The target variable for supervised learning problems.

        groups : array-like, with shape (n_samples,)
            Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into
            train/test set.

        Yields
        ------
        train : ndarray
            The training set indices for that split.

        test : ndarray
            The testing set indices for that split.

        Notes
        -----
        Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
        split. You can make the results identical by setting ``random_state``
        to an integer.
