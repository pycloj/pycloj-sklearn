The :mod:`sklearn.feature_selection` module implements feature selection
algorithms. It currently includes univariate filter selection methods and the
recursive feature elimination algorithm.

(defn chi2 
  "Compute chi-squared stats between each non-negative feature and class.

    This score can be used to select the n_features features with the
    highest values for the test chi-squared statistic from X, which must
    contain only non-negative features such as booleans or frequencies
    (e.g., term counts in document classification), relative to the classes.

    Recall that the chi-square test measures dependence between stochastic
    variables, so using this function \"weeds out\" the features that are the
    most likely to be independent of class and therefore irrelevant for
    classification.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = (n_samples, n_features_in)
        Sample vectors.

    y : array-like, shape = (n_samples,)
        Target vector (class labels).

    Returns
    -------
    chi2 : array, shape = (n_features,)
        chi2 statistics of each feature.
    pval : array, shape = (n_features,)
        p-values of each feature.

    Notes
    -----
    Complexity of this algorithm is O(n_classes * n_features).

(defn f-classif

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} shape = [n_samples, n_features]
        The set of regressors that will be tested sequentially.

    y : array of shape(n_samples)
        The data matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    F : array, shape = [n_features,]
        The set of F values.

    pval : array, shape = [n_features,]

(defn f-oneway 
  "Performs a 1-way ANOVA.

    The one-way ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that 2 or more groups have
    the same population mean. The test is applied to samples from two or
    more groups, possibly with differing sizes.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args : array_like, sparse matrices
        sample1, sample2... The sample measurements should be given as
        arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    F-value : float
        The computed F-value of the test.
    p-value : float
        The associated p-value from the F-distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    The ANOVA test has important assumptions that must be satisfied in order
    for the associated p-value to be valid.

    1. The samples are independent
    2. Each sample is from a normally distributed population
    3. The population standard deviations of the groups are all equal. This
       property is known as homoscedasticity.

    If these assumptions are not true for a given set of data, it may still be
    possible to use the Kruskal-Wallis H-test (`scipy.stats.kruskal`_) although
    with some loss of power.

    The algorithm is from Heiman[2], pp.394-7.

    See ``scipy.stats.f_oneway`` that should give the same results while
    being less efficient.

(defn f-regression 
  "Univariate linear regression tests.

    Linear model for testing the individual effect of each of many regressors.
    This is a scoring function to be used in a feature selection procedure, not
    a free standing feature selection procedure.

    This is done in 2 steps:

    1. The correlation between each regressor and the target is computed,
       that is, ((X[:, i] - mean(X[:, i])) * (y - mean_y)) / (std(X[:, i]) *
       std(y)).
    2. It is converted to an F score then to a p-value.

    For more on usage see the :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}  shape = (n_samples, n_features)
        The set of regressors that will be tested sequentially.

    y : array of shape(n_samples).
        The data matrix

    center : True, bool,
        If true, X and y will be centered.

    Returns
    -------
    F : array, shape=(n_features,)
        F values of features.

    pval : array, shape=(n_features,)
        p-values of F-scores.

(defn mutual-info-classif 
  "Estimate mutual information for a discrete target variable.

    Mutual information (MI) [1]_ between two random variables is a non-negative
    value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal
    to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher
    values mean higher dependency.

    The function relies on nonparametric methods based on entropy estimation
    from k-nearest neighbors distances as described in [2]_ and [3]_. Both
    methods are based on the idea originally proposed in [4]_.

    It can be used for univariate features selection, read more in the
    :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array_like or sparse matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Feature matrix.

    y : array_like, shape (n_samples,)
        Target vector.

    discrete_features : {'auto', bool, array_like}, default 'auto'
        If bool, then determines whether to consider all features discrete
        or continuous. If array, then it should be either a boolean mask
        with shape (n_features,) or array with indices of discrete features.
        If 'auto', it is assigned to False for dense `X` and to True for
        sparse `X`.

    n_neighbors : int, default 3
        Number of neighbors to use for MI estimation for continuous variables,
        see [2]_ and [3]_. Higher values reduce variance of the estimation, but
        could introduce a bias.

    copy : bool, default True
        Whether to make a copy of the given data. If set to False, the initial
        data will be overwritten.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator for adding small noise
        to continuous variables in order to remove repeated values.  If int,
        random_state is the seed used by the random number generator; If
        RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator; If
        None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by
        `np.random`.

    Returns
    -------
    mi : ndarray, shape (n_features,)
        Estimated mutual information between each feature and the target.

    Notes
    -----
    1. The term \"discrete features\" is used instead of naming them
       \"categorical\", because it describes the essence more accurately.
       For example, pixel intensities of an image are discrete features
       (but hardly categorical) and you will get better results if mark them
       as such. Also note, that treating a continuous variable as discrete and
       vice versa will usually give incorrect results, so be attentive about that.
    2. True mutual information can't be negative. If its estimate turns out
       to be negative, it is replaced by zero.
