    way to summarize a precision-recall curve, see
    :func:`average_precision_score`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array, shape = [n]
        x coordinates. These must be either monotonic increasing or monotonic
        decreasing.
    y : array, shape = [n]
        y coordinates.
    reorder : boolean, optional (default='deprecated')
        Whether to sort x before computing. If False, assume that x must be
        either monotonic increasing or monotonic decreasing. If True, y is
        used to break ties when sorting x. Make sure that y has a monotonic
        relation to x when setting reorder to True.

        .. deprecated:: 0.20
           Parameter ``reorder`` has been deprecated in version 0.20 and will
           be removed in 0.22. It's introduced for roc_auc_score (not for

           from auc will be significantly influenced if x is sorted
           unexpectedly due to slight floating point error (See issue #9786).

(defn average-precision-score 
  "Compute average precision (AP) from prediction scores

    AP summarizes a precision-recall curve as the weighted mean of precisions
    achieved at each threshold, with the increase in recall from the previous
    threshold used as the weight:

    .. math::
        \text{AP} = \sum_n (R_n - R_{n-1}) P_n

    where :math:`P_n` and :math:`R_n` are the precision and recall at the nth
    threshold [1]_. This implementation is not interpolated and is different
    from computing the area under the precision-recall curve with the
    trapezoidal rule, which uses linear interpolation and can be too
    optimistic.

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task
    or multilabel classification task.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        True binary labels or binary label indicators.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by \"decision_function\" on some classifiers).

    average : string, [None, 'micro', 'macro' (default), 'samples', 'weighted']
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise,
        this determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label
            indicator matrix as a label.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label).
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average.

        Will be ignored when ``y_true`` is binary.

    pos_label : int or str (default=1)
        The label of the positive class. Only applied to binary ``y_true``.
        For multilabel-indicator ``y_true``, ``pos_label`` is fixed to 1.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

  "Input validation on an array, list, sparse matrix or similar.

    By default, the input is checked to be a non-empty 2D array containing
    only finite values. If the dtype of the array is object, attempt
    converting to float, raising on failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : object
        Input object to check / convert.

    accept_sparse : string, boolean or list/tuple of strings (default=False)
        String[s] representing allowed sparse matrix formats, such as 'csc',
        'csr', etc. If the input is sparse but not in the allowed format,
        it will be converted to the first listed format. True allows the input
        to be any format. False means that a sparse matrix input will
        raise an error.

    accept_large_sparse : bool (default=True)
        If a CSR, CSC, COO or BSR sparse matrix is supplied and accepted by
        accept_sparse, accept_large_sparse=False will cause it to be accepted
        only if its indices are stored with a 32-bit dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    dtype : string, type, list of types or None (default=\"numeric\")
        Data type of result. If None, the dtype of the input is preserved.
        If \"numeric\", dtype is preserved unless array.dtype is object.
        If dtype is a list of types, conversion on the first type is only
        performed if the dtype of the input is not in the list.

    order : 'F', 'C' or None (default=None)
        Whether an array will be forced to be fortran or c-style.
        When order is None (default), then if copy=False, nothing is ensured
        about the memory layout of the output array; otherwise (copy=True)
        the memory layout of the returned array is kept as close as possible
        to the original array.

    copy : boolean (default=False)
        Whether a forced copy will be triggered. If copy=False, a copy might
        be triggered by a conversion.

    force_all_finite : boolean or 'allow-nan', (default=True)
        Whether to raise an error on np.inf and np.nan in array. The
        possibilities are:

        - True: Force all values of array to be finite.
        - False: accept both np.inf and np.nan in array.
        - 'allow-nan': accept only np.nan values in array. Values cannot
          be infinite.

        For object dtyped data, only np.nan is checked and not np.inf.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``force_all_finite`` accepts the string ``'allow-nan'``.

    ensure_2d : boolean (default=True)
        Whether to raise a value error if array is not 2D.

    allow_nd : boolean (default=False)
        Whether to allow array.ndim > 2.

    ensure_min_samples : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the array has a minimum number of samples in its first
        axis (rows for a 2D array). Setting to 0 disables this check.

    ensure_min_features : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the 2D array has some minimum number of features
        (columns). The default value of 1 rejects empty datasets.
        This check is only enforced when the input data has effectively 2
        dimensions or is originally 1D and ``ensure_2d`` is True. Setting to 0
        disables this check.

    warn_on_dtype : boolean or None, optional (default=None)
        Raise DataConversionWarning if the dtype of the input data structure
        does not match the requested dtype, causing a memory copy.

        .. deprecated:: 0.21
            ``warn_on_dtype`` is deprecated in version 0.21 and will be

(defn precision-recall-curve

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.

    The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample
    that is negative.

    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

    The last precision and recall values are 1. and 0. respectively and do not

        The options are 'average', 'min', 'max', 'dense' and 'ordinal'.

        'average':
            The average of the ranks that would have been assigned to
            all the tied values is assigned to each value.
        'min':
            The minimum of the ranks that would have been assigned to all
            the tied values is assigned to each value.  (This is also
            referred to as \"competition\" ranking.)
        'max':
            The maximum of the ranks that would have been assigned to all
            the tied values is assigned to each value.
        'dense':
            Like 'min', but the rank of the next highest element is assigned
            the rank immediately after those assigned to the tied elements.
        'ordinal':
            All values are given a distinct rank, corresponding to the order
            that the values occur in `a`.

        The default is 'average'.

    Returns
    -------
    ranks : ndarray
         An array of length equal to the size of `a`, containing rank
         scores.

(defn roc-auc-score 
  "Compute Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC)
    from prediction scores.

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task
    or multilabel classification task in label indicator format.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <roc_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        True binary labels or binary label indicators.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_classes]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by \"decision_function\" on some classifiers). For binary
        y_true, y_score is supposed to be the score of the class with greater
        label.

    average : string, [None, 'micro', 'macro' (default), 'samples', 'weighted']
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise,
        this determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label
            indicator matrix as a label.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label).
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average.

        Will be ignored when ``y_true`` is binary.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    max_fpr : float > 0 and <= 1, optional
        If not ``None``, the standardized partial AUC [3]_ over the range
        [0, max_fpr] is returned.

    auc : float

(defn roc-curve 
  "Compute Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <roc_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True binary labels. If labels are not either {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, then
        pos_label should be explicitly given.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by \"decision_function\" on some classifiers).

    pos_label : int or str, default=None
        The label of the positive class.
        When ``pos_label=None``, if y_true is in {-1, 1} or {0, 1},
        ``pos_label`` is set to 1, otherwise an error will be raised.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape = [n_samples], optional
        Sample weights.

    drop_intermediate : boolean, optional (default=True)
        Whether to drop some suboptimal thresholds which would not appear
        on a plotted ROC curve. This is useful in order to create lighter
        ROC curves.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           parameter *drop_intermediate*.

    Returns
    -------
    fpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing false positive rates such that element i is the false
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    tpr : array, shape = [>2]
        Increasing true positive rates such that element i is the true
        positive rate of predictions with score >= thresholds[i].

    thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds]
        Decreasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        fpr and tpr. `thresholds[0]` represents no instances being predicted
        and is arbitrarily set to `max(y_score) + 1`.

    See also
    --------
    roc_auc_score : Compute the area under the ROC curve

    Notes
    -----
    Since the thresholds are sorted from low to high values, they
    are reversed upon returning them to ensure they correspond to both ``fpr``
    and ``tpr``, which are sorted in reversed order during their calculation.
