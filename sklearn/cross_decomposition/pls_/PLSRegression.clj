  "PLS regression

    PLSRegression implements the PLS 2 blocks regression known as PLS2 or PLS1
    in case of one dimensional response.
    This class inherits from _PLS with mode=\"A\", deflation_mode=\"regression\",
    norm_y_weights=False and algorithm=\"nipals\".

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_decomposition>`.

    max_iter : an integer, (default 500)
        the maximum number of iterations of the NIPALS inner loop (used
        only if algorithm=\"nipals\")

    tol : non-negative real
        Tolerance used in the iterative algorithm default 1e-06.

    copy : boolean, default True

        x_rotations_ = W (P.T W)^(-1)
        y_rotations_ = C (Q.T C)^(-1)

    where Xk and Yk are residual matrices at iteration k.

    `Slides explaining
    PLS <http://www.eigenvector.com/Docs/Wise_pls_properties.pdf>`_


    For each component k, find weights u, v that optimizes:
    ``max corr(Xk u, Yk v) * std(Xk u) std(Yk u)``, such that ``|u| = 1``

    Note that it maximizes both the correlations between the scores and the
    intra-block variances.

    The residual matrix of X (Xk+1) block is obtained by the deflation on
    the current X score: x_score.

    The residual matrix of Y (Yk+1) block is obtained by deflation on the
    current X score. This performs the PLS regression known as PLS2. This
    mode is prediction oriented.

    This implementation provides the same results that 3 PLS packages
    provided in the R language (R-project):

        - \"mixOmics\" with function pls(X, Y, mode = \"regression\")
        - \"plspm \" with function plsreg2(X, Y)
        - \"pls\" with function oscorespls.fit(X, Y)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.cross_decomposition import PLSRegression
    >>> X = [[0., 0., 1.], [1.,0.,0.], [2.,2.,2.], [2.,5.,4.]]
    >>> Y = [[0.1, -0.2], [0.9, 1.1], [6.2, 5.9], [11.9, 12.3]]
    >>> pls2 = PLSRegression(n_components=2)
    >>> pls2.fit(X, Y)
    ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    PLSRegression(copy=True, max_iter=500, n_components=2, scale=True,
            tol=1e-06)
    >>> Y_pred = pls2.predict(X)

(defn score 
  "Returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction.

        The coefficient R^2 is defined as (1 - u/v), where u is the residual

        sum of squares ((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum().
        The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the
        model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always
        predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features,
        would get a R^2 score of 0.0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)

            precomputed kernel matrix instead, shape = (n_samples,
            n_samples_fitted], where n_samples_fitted is the number of
            samples used in the fitting for the estimator.

        y : array-like, shape = (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
            True values for X.

        -------

        Notes
        -----
        The R2 score used when calling ``score`` on a regressor will use
        ``multioutput='uniform_average'`` from version 0.23 to keep consistent
        with `metrics.r2_score`. This will influence the ``score`` method of
        all the multioutput regressors (except for
        `multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor`). To specify the default value
        manually and avoid the warning, please either call `metrics.r2_score`
        directly or make a custom scorer with `metrics.make_scorer` (the
        built-in scorer ``'r2'`` uses ``multioutput='uniform_average'``).
