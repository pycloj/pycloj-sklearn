(defn check-array 
  "Input validation on an array, list, sparse matrix or similar.

    By default, the input is checked to be a non-empty 2D array containing
    only finite values. If the dtype of the array is object, attempt
    converting to float, raising on failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : object
        Input object to check / convert.

    accept_sparse : string, boolean or list/tuple of strings (default=False)
        String[s] representing allowed sparse matrix formats, such as 'csc',
        'csr', etc. If the input is sparse but not in the allowed format,
        it will be converted to the first listed format. True allows the input
        to be any format. False means that a sparse matrix input will
        raise an error.

    accept_large_sparse : bool (default=True)
        If a CSR, CSC, COO or BSR sparse matrix is supplied and accepted by
        accept_sparse, accept_large_sparse=False will cause it to be accepted
        only if its indices are stored with a 32-bit dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    dtype : string, type, list of types or None (default=\"numeric\")
        Data type of result. If None, the dtype of the input is preserved.
        If \"numeric\", dtype is preserved unless array.dtype is object.
        If dtype is a list of types, conversion on the first type is only
        performed if the dtype of the input is not in the list.

    order : 'F', 'C' or None (default=None)
        Whether an array will be forced to be fortran or c-style.
        When order is None (default), then if copy=False, nothing is ensured
        about the memory layout of the output array; otherwise (copy=True)
        the memory layout of the returned array is kept as close as possible
        to the original array.

    copy : boolean (default=False)
        Whether a forced copy will be triggered. If copy=False, a copy might
        be triggered by a conversion.

    force_all_finite : boolean or 'allow-nan', (default=True)
        Whether to raise an error on np.inf and np.nan in array. The
        possibilities are:

        - True: Force all values of array to be finite.
        - False: accept both np.inf and np.nan in array.
        - 'allow-nan': accept only np.nan values in array. Values cannot
          be infinite.

        For object dtyped data, only np.nan is checked and not np.inf.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``force_all_finite`` accepts the string ``'allow-nan'``.

    ensure_2d : boolean (default=True)
        Whether to raise a value error if array is not 2D.

    allow_nd : boolean (default=False)
        Whether to allow array.ndim > 2.

    ensure_min_samples : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the array has a minimum number of samples in its first
        axis (rows for a 2D array). Setting to 0 disables this check.

    ensure_min_features : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the 2D array has some minimum number of features
        (columns). The default value of 1 rejects empty datasets.
        This check is only enforced when the input data has effectively 2
        dimensions or is originally 1D and ``ensure_2d`` is True. Setting to 0
        disables this check.

    warn_on_dtype : boolean or None, optional (default=None)
        Raise DataConversionWarning if the dtype of the input data structure
        does not match the requested dtype, causing a memory copy.

        .. deprecated:: 0.21
            ``warn_on_dtype`` is deprecated in version 0.21 and will be
            removed in 0.23.

    estimator : str or estimator instance (default=None)
        If passed, include the name of the estimator in warning messages.

    Returns
    -------
    array_converted : object
        The converted and validated array.

(defn eigsh 
  "
    Find k eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the real symmetric square matrix
    or complex hermitian matrix A.

    Solves ``A * x[i] = w[i] * x[i]``, the standard eigenvalue problem for
    w[i] eigenvalues with corresponding eigenvectors x[i].

    If M is specified, solves ``A * x[i] = w[i] * M * x[i]``, the
    generalized eigenvalue problem for w[i] eigenvalues
    with corresponding eigenvectors x[i].

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : ndarray, sparse matrix or LinearOperator
        A square operator representing the operation ``A * x``, where ``A`` is
        real symmetric or complex hermitian. For buckling mode (see below)
        ``A`` must additionally be positive-definite.
    k : int, optional
        The number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors desired.
        `k` must be smaller than N. It is not possible to compute all
        eigenvectors of a matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    w : array
        Array of k eigenvalues.
    v : array
        An array representing the `k` eigenvectors.  The column ``v[:, i]`` is
        the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue ``w[i]``.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    M : An N x N matrix, array, sparse matrix, or linear operator representing
        the operation ``M @ x`` for the generalized eigenvalue problem

            A @ x = w * M @ x.

        M must represent a real, symmetric matrix if A is real, and must
        represent a complex, hermitian matrix if A is complex. For best
        results, the data type of M should be the same as that of A.
        Additionally:

            If sigma is None, M is symmetric positive definite.

            If sigma is specified, M is symmetric positive semi-definite.

            In buckling mode, M is symmetric indefinite.

        If sigma is None, eigsh requires an operator to compute the solution
        of the linear equation ``M @ x = b``. This is done internally via a
        (sparse) LU decomposition for an explicit matrix M, or via an
        iterative solver for a general linear operator.  Alternatively,
        the user can supply the matrix or operator Minv, which gives
        ``x = Minv @ b = M^-1 @ b``.
    sigma : real
        Find eigenvalues near sigma using shift-invert mode.  This requires
        an operator to compute the solution of the linear system
        ``[A - sigma * M] x = b``, where M is the identity matrix if
        unspecified.  This is computed internally via a (sparse) LU
        decomposition for explicit matrices A & M, or via an iterative
        solver if either A or M is a general linear operator.
        Alternatively, the user can supply the matrix or operator OPinv,
        which gives ``x = OPinv @ b = [A - sigma * M]^-1 @ b``.
        Note that when sigma is specified, the keyword 'which' refers to
        the shifted eigenvalues ``w'[i]`` where:

            if mode == 'normal', ``w'[i] = 1 / (w[i] - sigma)``.

            if mode == 'cayley', ``w'[i] = (w[i] + sigma) / (w[i] - sigma)``.

            if mode == 'buckling', ``w'[i] = w[i] / (w[i] - sigma)``.

        (see further discussion in 'mode' below)
    v0 : ndarray, optional
        Starting vector for iteration.
        Default: random
    ncv : int, optional
        The number of Lanczos vectors generated ncv must be greater than k and
        smaller than n; it is recommended that ``ncv > 2*k``.
        Default: ``min(n, max(2*k + 1, 20))``
    which : str ['LM' | 'SM' | 'LA' | 'SA' | 'BE']
        If A is a complex hermitian matrix, 'BE' is invalid.
        Which `k` eigenvectors and eigenvalues to find:

            'LM' : Largest (in magnitude) eigenvalues.

            'SM' : Smallest (in magnitude) eigenvalues.

            'LA' : Largest (algebraic) eigenvalues.

            'SA' : Smallest (algebraic) eigenvalues.

            'BE' : Half (k/2) from each end of the spectrum.

        When k is odd, return one more (k/2+1) from the high end.
        When sigma != None, 'which' refers to the shifted eigenvalues ``w'[i]``
        (see discussion in 'sigma', above).  ARPACK is generally better
        at finding large values than small values.  If small eigenvalues are
        desired, consider using shift-invert mode for better performance.
    maxiter : int, optional
        Maximum number of Arnoldi update iterations allowed.
        Default: ``n*10``
    tol : float
        Relative accuracy for eigenvalues (stopping criterion).
        The default value of 0 implies machine precision.
    Minv : N x N matrix, array, sparse matrix, or LinearOperator
        See notes in M, above.
    OPinv : N x N matrix, array, sparse matrix, or LinearOperator
        See notes in sigma, above.
    return_eigenvectors : bool
        Return eigenvectors (True) in addition to eigenvalues. This value determines
        the order in which eigenvalues are sorted. The sort order is also dependent on the `which` variable.

            For which = 'LM' or 'SA':
                If `return_eigenvectors` is True, eigenvalues are sorted by algebraic value.

                If `return_eigenvectors` is False, eigenvalues are sorted by absolute value.

            For which = 'BE' or 'LA':
                eigenvalues are always sorted by algebraic value.

            For which = 'SM':
                If `return_eigenvectors` is True, eigenvalues are sorted by algebraic value.

                If `return_eigenvectors` is False, eigenvalues are sorted by decreasing absolute value.

    mode : string ['normal' | 'buckling' | 'cayley']
        Specify strategy to use for shift-invert mode.  This argument applies
        only for real-valued A and sigma != None.  For shift-invert mode,
        ARPACK internally solves the eigenvalue problem
        ``OP * x'[i] = w'[i] * B * x'[i]``
        and transforms the resulting Ritz vectors x'[i] and Ritz values w'[i]
        into the desired eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the problem
        ``A * x[i] = w[i] * M * x[i]``.
        The modes are as follows:

            'normal' :
                OP = [A - sigma * M]^-1 @ M,
                B = M,
                w'[i] = 1 / (w[i] - sigma)

            'buckling' :
                OP = [A - sigma * M]^-1 @ A,
                B = A,
                w'[i] = w[i] / (w[i] - sigma)

            'cayley' :
                OP = [A - sigma * M]^-1 @ [A + sigma * M],
                B = M,
                w'[i] = (w[i] + sigma) / (w[i] - sigma)

        The choice of mode will affect which eigenvalues are selected by
        the keyword 'which', and can also impact the stability of
        convergence (see [2] for a discussion).

    Raises
    ------
    ArpackNoConvergence
        When the requested convergence is not obtained.

        The currently converged eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be found
        as ``eigenvalues`` and ``eigenvectors`` attributes of the exception
        object.

(defn pairwise-kernels 
  "Compute the kernel between arrays X and optional array Y.

    This method takes either a vector array or a kernel matrix, and returns
    a kernel matrix. If the input is a vector array, the kernels are
    computed. If the input is a kernel matrix, it is returned instead.

    This method provides a safe way to take a kernel matrix as input, while
    preserving compatibility with many other algorithms that take a vector
    array.

    If Y is given (default is None), then the returned matrix is the pairwise
    kernel between the arrays from both X and Y.

    Valid values for metric are::
        ['additive_chi2', 'chi2', 'linear', 'poly', 'polynomial', 'rbf',
         'laplacian', 'sigmoid', 'cosine']

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array [n_samples_a, n_samples_a] if metric == \"precomputed\", or,              [n_samples_a, n_features] otherwise
        Array of pairwise kernels between samples, or a feature array.

    Y : array [n_samples_b, n_features]
        A second feature array only if X has shape [n_samples_a, n_features].

    metric : string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating kernel between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the metrics
        in pairwise.PAIRWISE_KERNEL_FUNCTIONS.
        If metric is \"precomputed\", X is assumed to be a kernel matrix.
        Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays from X as input and return a value indicating
        the distance between them.

    filter_params : boolean
        Whether to filter invalid parameters or not.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by breaking
        down the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing them in
        parallel.

        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    **kwds : optional keyword parameters
        Any further parameters are passed directly to the kernel function.

    Returns
    -------
    K : array [n_samples_a, n_samples_a] or [n_samples_a, n_samples_b]
        A kernel matrix K such that K_{i, j} is the kernel between the
        ith and jth vectors of the given matrix X, if Y is None.
        If Y is not None, then K_{i, j} is the kernel between the ith array
        from X and the jth array from Y.

    -----
    If metric is 'precomputed', Y is ignored and X is returned.
