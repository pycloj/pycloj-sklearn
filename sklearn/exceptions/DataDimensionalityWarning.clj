(ns sklearn.exceptions.DataDimensionalityWarning
  "Custom warning to notify potential issues with data dimensionality.

    For example, in random projection, this warning is raised when the
    number of components, which quantifies the dimensionality of the target
    projection space, is higher than the number of features, which quantifies
    the dimensionality of the original source space, to imply that the
    dimensionality of the problem will not be reduced.
