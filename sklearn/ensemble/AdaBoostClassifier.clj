(ns sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier
  "An AdaBoost classifier.

    An AdaBoost [1] classifier is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a
    classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the
    classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly
    classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus
    more on difficult cases.

    This class implements the algorithm known as AdaBoost-SAMME [2].

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <adaboost>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_estimator : object, optional (default=None)
        The base estimator from which the boosted ensemble is built.
        Support for sample weighting is required, as well as proper
        ``classes_`` and ``n_classes_`` attributes. If ``None``, then
        the base estimator is ``DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)``

    n_estimators : integer, optional (default=50)
        The maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated.
        In case of perfect fit, the learning procedure is stopped early.

    learning_rate : float, optional (default=1.)
        Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each classifier by
        ``learning_rate``. There is a trade-off between ``learning_rate`` and
        ``n_estimators``.

    algorithm : {'SAMME', 'SAMME.R'}, optional (default='SAMME.R')
        If 'SAMME.R' then use the SAMME.R real boosting algorithm.
        ``base_estimator`` must support calculation of class probabilities.
        If 'SAMME' then use the SAMME discrete boosting algorithm.
        The SAMME.R algorithm typically converges faster than SAMME,
        achieving a lower test error with fewer boosting iterations.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of classifiers
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    classes_ : array of shape = [n_classes]
        The classes labels.

    n_classes_ : int
        The number of classes.

    estimator_weights_ : array of floats
        Weights for each estimator in the boosted ensemble.

    estimator_errors_ : array of floats
        Classification error for each estimator in the boosted
        ensemble.

    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances if supported by the ``base_estimator``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    >>> X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=4,
    ...                            n_informative=2, n_redundant=0,
    ...                            random_state=0, shuffle=False)
    >>> clf = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
    >>> clf.fit(X, y)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    AdaBoostClassifier(algorithm='SAMME.R', base_estimator=None,
            learning_rate=1.0, n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
    >>> clf.feature_importances_  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    array([0.28..., 0.42..., 0.14..., 0.16...])
