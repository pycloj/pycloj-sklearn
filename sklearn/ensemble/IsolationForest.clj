  "Isolation Forest Algorithm

    Return the anomaly score of each sample using the IsolationForest algorithm

    The IsolationForest 'isolates' observations by randomly selecting a feature
    and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum
    values of the selected feature.

    Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the
    number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path
    length from the root node to the terminating node.

    This path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a
    measure of normality and our decision function.

    Random partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies.
    Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path
    lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, optional (default=100)
        The number of base estimators in the ensemble.

    max_samples : int or float, optional (default=\"auto\")
        The number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.
            - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
            - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples.
            - If \"auto\", then `max_samples=min(256, n_samples)`.

        If max_samples is larger than the number of samples provided,
        all samples will be used for all trees (no sampling).

    contamination : float in (0., 0.5), optional (default=0.1)
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. Used when fitting to define the threshold
        on the decision function. If 'auto', the decision function threshold is
        determined as in the original paper.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
           The default value of ``contamination`` will change from 0.1 in 0.20
           to ``'auto'`` in 0.22.

    max_features : int or float, optional (default=1.0)
        The number of features to draw from X to train each base estimator.

            - If int, then draw `max_features` features.
            - If float, then draw `max_features * X.shape[1]` features.

    bootstrap : boolean, optional (default=False)
        If True, individual trees are fit on random subsets of the training
        data sampled with replacement. If False, sampling without replacement
        is performed.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    behaviour : str, default='old'
        Behaviour of the ``decision_function`` which can be either 'old' or
        'new'. Passing ``behaviour='new'`` makes the ``decision_function``
        change to match other anomaly detection algorithm API which will be
        the default behaviour in the future. As explained in details in the
        ``offset_`` attribute documentation, the ``decision_function`` becomes
        dependent on the contamination parameter, in such a way that 0 becomes
        its natural threshold to detect outliers.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``behaviour`` is added in 0.20 for back-compatibility purpose.

        .. deprecated:: 0.20
           ``behaviour='old'`` is deprecated in 0.20 and will not be possible
           in 0.22.

        .. deprecated:: 0.22
           ``behaviour`` parameter will be deprecated in 0.22 and removed in
           0.24.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.

    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.21

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeClassifier
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    estimators_samples_ : list of arrays
        The subset of drawn samples (i.e., the in-bag samples) for each base
        estimator.

    max_samples_ : integer
        The actual number of samples

    offset_ : float
        Offset used to define the decision function from the raw scores.
        We have the relation: ``decision_function = score_samples - offset_``.
        Assuming behaviour == 'new', ``offset_`` is defined as follows.
        When the contamination parameter is set to \"auto\", the offset is equal
        to -0.5 as the scores of inliers are close to 0 and the scores of
        outliers are close to -1. When a contamination parameter different
        than \"auto\" is provided, the offset is defined in such a way we obtain
        the expected number of outliers (samples with decision function < 0)
        in training.
        Assuming the behaviour parameter is set to 'old', we always have
        ``offset_ = -0.5``, making the decision function independent from the
        contamination parameter.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is based on an ensemble of ExtraTreeRegressor. The
    maximum depth of each tree is set to ``ceil(log_2(n))`` where
    :math:`n` is the number of samples used to build the tree
    (see (Liu et al., 2008) for more details).

(defn decision-function 
  "Average anomaly score of X of the base classifiers.

        The anomaly score of an input sample is computed as
        the mean anomaly score of the trees in the forest.

        The measure of normality of an observation given a tree is the depth
        of the leaf containing this observation, which is equivalent to
        the number of splittings required to isolate this point. In case of
        several observations n_left in the leaf, the average path length of
        a n_left samples isolation tree is added.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like or sparse matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            The input samples. Internally, it will be converted to
            ``dtype=np.float32`` and if a sparse matrix is provided
            to a sparse ``csr_matrix``.

        Returns
        -------
        scores : array, shape (n_samples,)
            The anomaly score of the input samples.
            The lower, the more abnormal. Negative scores represent outliers,
