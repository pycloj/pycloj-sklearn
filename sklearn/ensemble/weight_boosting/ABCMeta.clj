  "Metaclass for defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).

        Use this metaclass to create an ABC.  An ABC can be subclassed
        directly, and then acts as a mix-in class.  You can also register
        unrelated concrete classes (even built-in classes) and unrelated
        ABCs as 'virtual subclasses' -- these and their descendants will
        be considered subclasses of the registering ABC by the built-in
        issubclass() function, but the registering ABC won't show up in
        their MRO (Method Resolution Order) nor will method
        implementations defined by the registering ABC be callable (not
        even via super()).
