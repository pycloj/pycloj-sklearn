(ns sklearn.ensemble.weight-boosting.AdaBoostRegressor
  "An AdaBoost regressor.

    An AdaBoost [1] regressor is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a
    regressor on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the
    regressor on the same dataset but where the weights of instances are
    adjusted according to the error of the current prediction. As such,
    subsequent regressors focus more on difficult cases.

    This class implements the algorithm known as AdaBoost.R2 [2].

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <adaboost>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_estimator : object, optional (default=None)
        The base estimator from which the boosted ensemble is built.
        Support for sample weighting is required. If ``None``, then
        the base estimator is ``DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)``

    n_estimators : integer, optional (default=50)
        The maximum number of estimators at which boosting is terminated.
        In case of perfect fit, the learning procedure is stopped early.

    learning_rate : float, optional (default=1.)
        Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each regressor by
        ``learning_rate``. There is a trade-off between ``learning_rate`` and
        ``n_estimators``.

    loss : {'linear', 'square', 'exponential'}, optional (default='linear')
        The loss function to use when updating the weights after each
        boosting iteration.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of classifiers
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    estimator_weights_ : array of floats
        Weights for each estimator in the boosted ensemble.

    estimator_errors_ : array of floats
        Regression error for each estimator in the boosted ensemble.

    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances if supported by the ``base_estimator``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostRegressor
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    >>> X, y = make_regression(n_features=4, n_informative=2,
    ...                        random_state=0, shuffle=False)
    >>> regr = AdaBoostRegressor(random_state=0, n_estimators=100)
    >>> regr.fit(X, y)  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    AdaBoostRegressor(base_estimator=None, learning_rate=1.0, loss='linear',
            n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
    >>> regr.feature_importances_  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS

(defn score 
  "Returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction.

        The coefficient R^2 is defined as (1 - u/v), where u is the residual
        sum of squares ((y_true - y_pred) ** 2).sum() and v is the total
        sum of squares ((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum().
        The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the
        model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always
        predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features,
        would get a R^2 score of 0.0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)
            Test samples. For some estimators this may be a
            precomputed kernel matrix instead, shape = (n_samples,
            n_samples_fitted], where n_samples_fitted is the number of
            samples used in the fitting for the estimator.

        y : array-like, shape = (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
            True values for X.

            R^2 of self.predict(X) wrt. y.

        Notes
        -----
        The R2 score used when calling ``score`` on a regressor will use
        ``multioutput='uniform_average'`` from version 0.23 to keep consistent
        with `metrics.r2_score`. This will influence the ``score`` method of
        all the multioutput regressors (except for
        `multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor`). To specify the default value
        manually and avoid the warning, please either call `metrics.r2_score`
        directly or make a custom scorer with `metrics.make_scorer` (the
        built-in scorer ``'r2'`` uses ``multioutput='uniform_average'``).
