(ns sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor
  "An extra-trees regressor.

    This class implements a meta estimator that fits a number of
    randomized decision trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples
    of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy
    and control over-fitting.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <forest>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : integer, optional (default=10)
        The number of trees in the forest.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.20
           The default value of ``n_estimators`` will change from 10 in
           version 0.20 to 100 in version 0.22.

    criterion : string, optional (default=\"mse\")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are \"mse\" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance
        reduction as feature selection criterion, and \"mae\" for the mean
        absolute error.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

    max_depth : integer or None, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=\"auto\")
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If \"auto\", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If \"sqrt\", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If \"log2\", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, optional (default=0.)
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    min_impurity_split : float, (default=1e-7)
        Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
        if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.

        .. deprecated:: 0.19
           ``min_impurity_split`` has been deprecated in favor of
           ``min_impurity_decrease`` in 0.19. The default value of
           ``min_impurity_split`` will change from 1e-7 to 0 in 0.23 and it
           will be removed in 0.25. Use ``min_impurity_decrease`` instead.

    bootstrap : boolean, optional (default=False)
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole datset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool, optional (default=False)
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the R^2 on unseen data.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeRegressor
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances (the higher, the more important the feature).

    n_features_ : int
        The number of features.

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs.

    oob_score_ : float
        Score of the training dataset obtained using an out-of-bag estimate.

    oob_prediction_ : array of shape = [n_samples]
        Prediction computed with out-of-bag estimate on the training set.

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

            Test samples. For some estimators this may be a
            precomputed kernel matrix instead, shape = (n_samples,
            n_samples_fitted], where n_samples_fitted is the number of
            samples used in the fitting for the estimator.

        y : array-like, shape = (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
            True values for X.

        sample_weight : array-like, shape = [n_samples], optional
            Sample weights.

        Returns
        -------
        score : float
            R^2 of self.predict(X) wrt. y.

        Notes
        -----
        The R2 score used when calling ``score`` on a regressor will use
        ``multioutput='uniform_average'`` from version 0.23 to keep consistent
        with `metrics.r2_score`. This will influence the ``score`` method of
        all the multioutput regressors (except for
        `multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor`). To specify the default value
        manually and avoid the warning, please either call `metrics.r2_score`
        directly or make a custom scorer with `metrics.make_scorer` (the
        built-in scorer ``'r2'`` uses ``multioutput='uniform_average'``).

  "Set the parameters of this estimator.

        The method works on simple estimators as well as on nested objects
        (such as pipelines). The latter have parameters of the form
        ``<component>__<parameter>`` so that it's possible to update each
        component of a nested object.
