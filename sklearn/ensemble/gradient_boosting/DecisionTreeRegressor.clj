  "A decision tree regressor.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <tree>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : string, optional (default=\"mse\")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are \"mse\" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance
        reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2 loss
        using the mean of each terminal node, \"friedman_mse\", which uses mean
        squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential splits,
        and \"mae\" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes the L1 loss
        using the median of each terminal node.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

    splitter : string, optional (default=\"best\")
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are \"best\" to choose the best split and \"random\" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_depth : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If \"auto\", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If \"sqrt\", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If \"log2\", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, optional (default=0.)
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    min_impurity_split : float, (default=1e-7)
        Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
        if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.

        .. deprecated:: 0.19
           ``min_impurity_split`` has been deprecated in favor of
           ``min_impurity_decrease`` in 0.19. The default value of
           ``min_impurity_split`` will change from 1e-7 to 0 in 0.23 and it
           will be removed in 0.25. Use ``min_impurity_decrease`` instead.

    presort : bool, optional (default=False)
        Whether to presort the data to speed up the finding of best splits in
        fitting. For the default settings of a decision tree on large
        datasets, setting this to true may slow down the training process.
        When using either a smaller dataset or a restricted depth, this may
        speed up the training.

    Attributes
    ----------
    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
        The importance of a feature is computed as the
        (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought
        by that feature. It is also known as the Gini importance [4]_.

    max_features_ : int,
        The inferred value of max_features.

    n_features_ : int
        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

    tree_ : Tree object
        The underlying Tree object. Please refer to
        ``help(sklearn.tree._tree.Tree)`` for attributes of Tree object and
        :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_unveil_tree_structure.py`
        for basic usage of these attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.

    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,
    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data and
    ``max_features=n_features``, if the improvement of the criterion is
    identical for several splits enumerated during the search of the best
    split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during fitting,
    ``random_state`` has to be fixed.

            contained subobjects that are estimators.

(defn predict 
  "Predict class or regression value for X.

        For a classification model, the predicted class for each sample in X is
        returned. For a regression model, the predicted value based on X is
        returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like or sparse matrix of shape = [n_samples, n_features]
            The input samples. Internally, it will be converted to
            ``dtype=np.float32`` and if a sparse matrix is provided
            to a sparse ``csr_matrix``.

        check_input : boolean, (default=True)
            Allow to bypass several input checking.

        Returns
        -------
        y : array of shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_outputs]
            The predicted classes, or the predict values.

(defn score 
  "Returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction.

        The coefficient R^2 is defined as (1 - u/v), where u is the residual
        sum of squares ((y_true - y_pred) ** 2).sum() and v is the total
        sum of squares ((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum().
        The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the
        model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always
        predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features,
        would get a R^2 score of 0.0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)
            Test samples. For some estimators this may be a
            precomputed kernel matrix instead, shape = (n_samples,
            n_samples_fitted], where n_samples_fitted is the number of
            samples used in the fitting for the estimator.

        y : array-like, shape = (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
            True values for X.

        sample_weight : array-like, shape = [n_samples], optional
            Sample weights.

        Returns
        -------
        score : float
            R^2 of self.predict(X) wrt. y.

        Notes
        -----
        The R2 score used when calling ``score`` on a regressor will use
        ``multioutput='uniform_average'`` from version 0.23 to keep consistent
        with `metrics.r2_score`. This will influence the ``score`` method of
        all the multioutput regressors (except for
        `multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor`). To specify the default value
        manually and avoid the warning, please either call `metrics.r2_score`
        directly or make a custom scorer with `metrics.make_scorer` (the
        built-in scorer ``'r2'`` uses ``multioutput='uniform_average'``).

(defn set-params 
  "Set the parameters of this estimator.

        The method works on simple estimators as well as on nested objects

        component of a nested object.
