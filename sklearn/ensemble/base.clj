    Requires that the metaclass is ABCMeta or derived from it.  A
    class that has a metaclass derived from ABCMeta cannot be
    instantiated unless all of its abstract methods are overridden.
    The abstract methods can be called using any of the normal
    'super' call mechanisms.

    Usage:

        class C(metaclass=ABCMeta):

            def my_abstract_method(self, ...):

        If seed is an int, return a new RandomState instance seeded with seed.

    Clone does a deep copy of the model in an estimator

    ----------
    estimator : estimator object, or list, tuple or set of objects
        The estimator or group of estimators to be cloned

    safe : boolean, optional
        If safe is false, clone will fall back to a deep copy on objects
        that are not estimators.

(defn effective-n-jobs 
  "Determine the number of jobs that can actually run in parallel

    n_jobs is the number of workers requested by the callers. Passing n_jobs=-1
    means requesting all available workers for instance matching the number of
    CPU cores on the worker host(s).

    This method should return a guesstimate of the number of workers that can
    actually perform work concurrently with the currently enabled default
    backend. The primary use case is to make it possible for the caller to know
    in how many chunks to slice the work.

    In general working on larger data chunks is more efficient (less scheduling
    overhead and better use of CPU cache prefetching heuristics) as long as all
    the workers have enough work to do.

    Warning: this function is experimental and subject to change in a future
    version of joblib.
