(ns sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN
  "Perform DBSCAN clustering from vector array or distance matrix.

    DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
    Finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them.
    Good for data which contains clusters of similar density.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <dbscan>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eps : float, optional
        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered
        as in the neighborhood of the other. This is not a maximum bound
        on the distances of points within a cluster. This is the most
        important DBSCAN parameter to choose appropriately for your data set
        and distance function.

    min_samples : int, optional
        The number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point
        to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself.

    metric : string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string or callable, it must be one of
        the options allowed by :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances` for
        its metric parameter.
        If metric is \"precomputed\", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square. X may be a sparse matrix, in which case only \"nonzero\"
        elements may be considered neighbors for DBSCAN.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           metric *precomputed* to accept precomputed sparse matrix.

    metric_params : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        The algorithm to be used by the NearestNeighbors module
        to compute pointwise distances and find nearest neighbors.
        See NearestNeighbors module documentation for details.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or cKDTree. This can affect the speed
        of the construction and query, as well as the memory required
        to store the tree. The optimal value depends
        on the nature of the problem.

    p : float, optional
        The power of the Minkowski metric to be used to calculate distance
        between points.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    core_sample_indices_ : array, shape = [n_core_samples]
        Indices of core samples.

    components_ : array, shape = [n_core_samples, n_features]
        Copy of each core sample found by training.

    labels_ : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().
        Noisy samples are given the label -1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3],
    ...               [8, 7], [8, 8], [25, 80]])
    >>> clustering = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=2).fit(X)
    >>> clustering.labels_
    array([ 0,  0,  0,  1,  1, -1])
    >>> clustering # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    DBSCAN(algorithm='auto', eps=3, leaf_size=30, metric='euclidean',
        metric_params=None, min_samples=2, n_jobs=None, p=None)

    See also
    --------
    OPTICS
        A similar clustering at multiple values of eps. Our implementation
        is optimized for memory usage.

    Notes
    -----
    For an example, see :ref:`examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.py
    <sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_dbscan.py>`.

    This implementation bulk-computes all neighborhood queries, which increases
    the memory complexity to O(n.d) where d is the average number of neighbors,
    while original DBSCAN had memory complexity O(n). It may attract a higher
    memory complexity when querying these nearest neighborhoods, depending
    on the ``algorithm``.

    One way to avoid the query complexity is to pre-compute sparse
    neighborhoods in chunks using
    :func:`NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph
    <sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph>` with
    ``mode='distance'``, then using ``metric='precomputed'`` here.

    Another way to reduce memory and computation time is to remove
    (near-)duplicate points and use ``sample_weight`` instead.

    :class:`cluster.OPTICS` provides a similar clustering with lower memory
    usage.
