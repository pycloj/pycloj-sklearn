(ns sklearn.cluster.spectral.SpectralClustering
  "Apply clustering to a projection of the normalized Laplacian.

    In practice Spectral Clustering is very useful when the structure of
    the individual clusters is highly non-convex or more generally when
    a measure of the center and spread of the cluster is not a suitable
    description of the complete cluster. For instance when clusters are
    nested circles on the 2D plane.

    If affinity is the adjacency matrix of a graph, this method can be
    used to find normalized graph cuts.

    When calling ``fit``, an affinity matrix is constructed using either
    kernel function such the Gaussian (aka RBF) kernel of the euclidean
    distanced ``d(X, X)``::

            np.exp(-gamma * d(X,X) ** 2)

    or a k-nearest neighbors connectivity matrix.

    Alternatively, using ``precomputed``, a user-provided affinity
    matrix can be used.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <spectral_clustering>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : integer, optional
        The dimension of the projection subspace.

    eigen_solver : {None, 'arpack', 'lobpcg', or 'amg'}
        The eigenvalue decomposition strategy to use. AMG requires pyamg
        to be installed. It can be faster on very large, sparse problems,
        but may also lead to instabilities.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None (default)
        A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization of the
        lobpcg eigen vectors decomposition when ``eigen_solver='amg'`` and by
        the K-Means initialization. Use an int to make the randomness
        deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    n_init : int, optional, default: 10
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of
        n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia.

    gamma : float, default=1.0
        Kernel coefficient for rbf, poly, sigmoid, laplacian and chi2 kernels.
        Ignored for ``affinity='nearest_neighbors'``.

    affinity : string, array-like or callable, default 'rbf'
        If a string, this may be one of 'nearest_neighbors', 'precomputed',
        'rbf' or one of the kernels supported by
        `sklearn.metrics.pairwise_kernels`.

        Only kernels that produce similarity scores (non-negative values that
        increase with similarity) should be used. This property is not checked
        by the clustering algorithm.

    n_neighbors : integer
        Number of neighbors to use when constructing the affinity matrix using
        the nearest neighbors method. Ignored for ``affinity='rbf'``.

    eigen_tol : float, optional, default: 0.0
        Stopping criterion for eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix
        when ``eigen_solver='arpack'``.

    assign_labels : {'kmeans', 'discretize'}, default: 'kmeans'
        The strategy to use to assign labels in the embedding
        space. There are two ways to assign labels after the laplacian
        embedding. k-means can be applied and is a popular choice. But it can
        also be sensitive to initialization. Discretization is another approach
        which is less sensitive to random initialization.

    degree : float, default=3
        Degree of the polynomial kernel. Ignored by other kernels.

    coef0 : float, default=1
        Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
        Ignored by other kernels.

    kernel_params : dictionary of string to any, optional
        Parameters (keyword arguments) and values for kernel passed as
        callable object. Ignored by other kernels.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    affinity_matrix_ : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Affinity matrix used for clustering. Available only if after calling
        ``fit``.

    labels_ :
        Labels of each point

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 0],
    ...               [4, 7], [3, 5], [3, 6]])
    >>> clustering = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=2,
    ...         assign_labels=\"discretize\",
    ...         random_state=0).fit(X)
    >>> clustering.labels_
    array([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])
    >>> clustering # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    SpectralClustering(affinity='rbf', assign_labels='discretize', coef0=1,
              degree=3, eigen_solver=None, eigen_tol=0.0, gamma=1.0,
              kernel_params=None, n_clusters=2, n_init=10, n_jobs=None,
              n_neighbors=10, random_state=0)

    Notes
    -----
    If you have an affinity matrix, such as a distance matrix,
    for which 0 means identical elements, and high values means
    very dissimilar elements, it can be transformed in a
    similarity matrix that is well suited for the algorithm by
    applying the Gaussian (RBF, heat) kernel::

        np.exp(- dist_matrix ** 2 / (2. * delta ** 2))

    Where ``delta`` is a free parameter representing the width of the Gaussian
    kernel.

    Another alternative is to take a symmetric version of the k
    nearest neighbors connectivity matrix of the points.

    If the pyamg package is installed, it is used: this greatly
    speeds up computation.
