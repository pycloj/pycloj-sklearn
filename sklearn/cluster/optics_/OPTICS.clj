  "Estimate clustering structure from vector array

    OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure), closely
    related to DBSCAN, finds core sample of high density and expands clusters
    from them [1]_. Unlike DBSCAN, keeps cluster hierarchy for a variable
    neighborhood radius. Better suited for usage on large datasets than the
    current sklearn implementation of DBSCAN.

    Clusters are then extracted using a DBSCAN-like method
    (cluster_method = 'dbscan') or an automatic
    technique proposed in [1]_ (cluster_method = 'xi').

    This implementation deviates from the original OPTICS by first performing
    k-nearest-neighborhood searches on all points to identify core sizes, then
    computing only the distances to unprocessed points when constructing the
    cluster order. Note that we do not employ a heap to manage the expansion
    candidates, so the time complexity will be O(n^2).

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_samples : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1 (default=5)
        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as
        a core point. Also, up and down steep regions can't have more then
        ``min_samples`` consecutive non-steep points. Expressed as an absolute
        number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be at least
        2).

    max_eps : float, optional (default=np.inf)
        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as
        in the neighborhood of the other. Default value of ``np.inf`` will
        identify clusters across all scales; reducing ``max_eps`` will result
        in shorter run times.

    metric : string or callable, optional (default='minkowski')
        Metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn
        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.

        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the
        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string. If metric is
        \"precomputed\", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and must be square.

        Valid values for metric are:

        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',
          'manhattan']

        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',
          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',
          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',
          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',
          'yule']

        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these
        metrics.

    p : integer, optional (default=2)
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        :class:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, optional (default=None)
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    cluster_method : string, optional (default='xi')
        The extraction method used to extract clusters using the calculated
        reachability and ordering. Possible values are \"xi\" and \"dbscan\".

    eps : float, optional (default=None)
        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as
        in the neighborhood of the other. By default it assumes the same value
        as ``max_eps``.
        Used only when ``cluster_method='dbscan'``.

    xi : float, between 0 and 1, optional (default=0.05)
        Determines the minimum steepness on the reachability plot that
        constitutes a cluster boundary. For example, an upwards point in the
        reachability plot is defined by the ratio from one point to its
        successor being at most 1-xi.
        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.

    predecessor_correction : bool, optional (default=True)
        Correct clusters according to the predecessors calculated by OPTICS
        [2]_. This parameter has minimal effect on most datasets.
        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.

    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1 (default=None)
        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an
        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be
        at least 2). If ``None``, the value of ``min_samples`` is used instead.
        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method. (default)

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default=30)
        Leaf size passed to :class:`BallTree` or :class:`KDTree`. This can
        affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    labels_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().
        Noisy samples and points which are not included in a leaf cluster
        of ``cluster_hierarchy_`` are labeled as -1.

    reachability_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Reachability distances per sample, indexed by object order. Use
        ``clust.reachability_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.

    ordering_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        The cluster ordered list of sample indices.

    core_distances_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Distance at which each sample becomes a core point, indexed by object
        order. Points which will never be core have a distance of inf. Use
        ``clust.core_distances_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.

    predecessor_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Point that a sample was reached from, indexed by object order.
        Seed points have a predecessor of -1.

    cluster_hierarchy_ : array, shape (n_clusters, 2)
        The list of clusters in the form of ``[start, end]`` in each row, with
        all indices inclusive. The clusters are ordered according to
        ``(end, -start)`` (ascending) so that larger clusters encompassing
        smaller clusters come after those smaller ones. Since ``labels_`` does
        not reflect the hierarchy, usually
        ``len(cluster_hierarchy_) > np.unique(optics.labels_)``. Please also
        note that these indices are of the ``ordering_``, i.e.
        ``X[ordering_][start:end + 1]`` form a cluster.
        Only available when ``cluster_method='xi'``.

    DBSCAN
        A similar clustering for a specified neighborhood radius (eps).
        Our implementation is optimized for runtime.
