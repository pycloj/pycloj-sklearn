  "Implements the Birch clustering algorithm.

    It is a memory-efficient, online-learning algorithm provided as an
    alternative to :class:`MiniBatchKMeans`. It constructs a tree
    data structure with the cluster centroids being read off the leaf.
    These can be either the final cluster centroids or can be provided as input
    to another clustering algorithm such as :class:`AgglomerativeClustering`.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <birch>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float, default 0.5
        The radius of the subcluster obtained by merging a new sample and the
        closest subcluster should be lesser than the threshold. Otherwise a new
        subcluster is started. Setting this value to be very low promotes
        splitting and vice-versa.

    branching_factor : int, default 50
        Maximum number of CF subclusters in each node. If a new samples enters
        such that the number of subclusters exceed the branching_factor then
        that node is split into two nodes with the subclusters redistributed
        in each. The parent subcluster of that node is removed and two new
        subclusters are added as parents of the 2 split nodes.

    n_clusters : int, instance of sklearn.cluster model, default 3
        Number of clusters after the final clustering step, which treats the
        subclusters from the leaves as new samples.

        - `None` : the final clustering step is not performed and the
          subclusters are returned as they are.

        - `sklearn.cluster` Estimator : If a model is provided, the model is
          fit treating the subclusters as new samples and the initial data is
          mapped to the label of the closest subcluster.

        - `int` : the model fit is :class:`AgglomerativeClustering` with
          `n_clusters` set to be equal to the int.

    compute_labels : bool, default True
        Whether or not to compute labels for each fit.

    copy : bool, default True
        Whether or not to make a copy of the given data. If set to False,
        the initial data will be overwritten.

    Attributes
    ----------
    root_ : _CFNode
        Root of the CFTree.

    dummy_leaf_ : _CFNode
        Start pointer to all the leaves.

    subcluster_centers_ : ndarray,
        Centroids of all subclusters read directly from the leaves.

    subcluster_labels_ : ndarray,
        Labels assigned to the centroids of the subclusters after
        they are clustered globally.

    labels_ : ndarray, shape (n_samples,)
        Array of labels assigned to the input data.
        if partial_fit is used instead of fit, they are assigned to the
        last batch of data.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.cluster import Birch
    >>> X = [[0, 1], [0.3, 1], [-0.3, 1], [0, -1], [0.3, -1], [-0.3, -1]]
    >>> brc = Birch(branching_factor=50, n_clusters=None, threshold=0.5,
    ... compute_labels=True)
    >>> brc.fit(X) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    Birch(branching_factor=50, compute_labels=True, copy=True, n_clusters=None,
       threshold=0.5)
    >>> brc.predict(X)
    array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])

    Notes
    -----
    The tree data structure consists of nodes with each node consisting of
    a number of subclusters. The maximum number of subclusters in a node
    is determined by the branching factor. Each subcluster maintains a
    linear sum, squared sum and the number of samples in that subcluster.
    In addition, each subcluster can also have a node as its child, if the
    subcluster is not a member of a leaf node.

    For a new point entering the root, it is merged with the subcluster closest
    to it and the linear sum, squared sum and the number of samples of that
    subcluster are updated. This is done recursively till the properties of
    the leaf node are updated.
