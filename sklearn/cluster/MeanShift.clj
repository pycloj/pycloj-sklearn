(ns sklearn.cluster.MeanShift
  "Mean shift clustering using a flat kernel.

    Mean shift clustering aims to discover \"blobs\" in a smooth density of
    samples. It is a centroid-based algorithm, which works by updating
    candidates for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given
    region. These candidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to
    eliminate near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids.

    Seeding is performed using a binning technique for scalability.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <mean_shift>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bandwidth : float, optional
        Bandwidth used in the RBF kernel.

        If not given, the bandwidth is estimated using
        sklearn.cluster.estimate_bandwidth; see the documentation for that
        function for hints on scalability (see also the Notes, below).

    seeds : array, shape=[n_samples, n_features], optional
        Seeds used to initialize kernels. If not set,
        the seeds are calculated by clustering.get_bin_seeds
        with bandwidth as the grid size and default values for
        other parameters.

    bin_seeding : boolean, optional
        If true, initial kernel locations are not locations of all
        points, but rather the location of the discretized version of
        points, where points are binned onto a grid whose coarseness
        corresponds to the bandwidth. Setting this option to True will speed
        up the algorithm because fewer seeds will be initialized.
        default value: False
        Ignored if seeds argument is not None.

    min_bin_freq : int, optional
       To speed up the algorithm, accept only those bins with at least
       min_bin_freq points as seeds. If not defined, set to 1.

    cluster_all : boolean, default True
        If true, then all points are clustered, even those orphans that are
        not within any kernel. Orphans are assigned to the nearest kernel.
        If false, then orphans are given cluster label -1.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by computing
        each of the n_init runs in parallel.

        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_ : array, [n_clusters, n_features]
        Coordinates of cluster centers.

    labels_ :
        Labels of each point.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.cluster import MeanShift
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 0],
    ...               [4, 7], [3, 5], [3, 6]])
    >>> clustering = MeanShift(bandwidth=2).fit(X)
    >>> clustering.labels_
    array([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])
    >>> clustering.predict([[0, 0], [5, 5]])
    array([1, 0])
    >>> clustering # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    MeanShift(bandwidth=2, bin_seeding=False, cluster_all=True, min_bin_freq=1,
         n_jobs=None, seeds=None)

    Notes
    -----

    Scalability:

    Because this implementation uses a flat kernel and
    a Ball Tree to look up members of each kernel, the complexity will tend
    towards O(T*n*log(n)) in lower dimensions, with n the number of samples
    and T the number of points. In higher dimensions the complexity will
    tend towards O(T*n^2).

    Scalability can be boosted by using fewer seeds, for example by using
    a higher value of min_bin_freq in the get_bin_seeds function.

    Note that the estimate_bandwidth function is much less scalable than the
    mean shift algorithm and will be the bottleneck if it is used.
