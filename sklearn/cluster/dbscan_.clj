(defn check-array 
  "Input validation on an array, list, sparse matrix or similar.

    By default, the input is checked to be a non-empty 2D array containing
    only finite values. If the dtype of the array is object, attempt
    converting to float, raising on failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : object
        Input object to check / convert.

    accept_sparse : string, boolean or list/tuple of strings (default=False)
        String[s] representing allowed sparse matrix formats, such as 'csc',
        'csr', etc. If the input is sparse but not in the allowed format,
        it will be converted to the first listed format. True allows the input
        to be any format. False means that a sparse matrix input will
        raise an error.

    accept_large_sparse : bool (default=True)
        If a CSR, CSC, COO or BSR sparse matrix is supplied and accepted by
        accept_sparse, accept_large_sparse=False will cause it to be accepted
        only if its indices are stored with a 32-bit dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    dtype : string, type, list of types or None (default=\"numeric\")
        Data type of result. If None, the dtype of the input is preserved.
        If \"numeric\", dtype is preserved unless array.dtype is object.
        If dtype is a list of types, conversion on the first type is only
        performed if the dtype of the input is not in the list.

    order : 'F', 'C' or None (default=None)
        Whether an array will be forced to be fortran or c-style.
        When order is None (default), then if copy=False, nothing is ensured
        about the memory layout of the output array; otherwise (copy=True)
        the memory layout of the returned array is kept as close as possible
        to the original array.

    copy : boolean (default=False)
        Whether a forced copy will be triggered. If copy=False, a copy might
        be triggered by a conversion.

    force_all_finite : boolean or 'allow-nan', (default=True)
        Whether to raise an error on np.inf and np.nan in array. The
        possibilities are:

        - True: Force all values of array to be finite.
        - False: accept both np.inf and np.nan in array.
        - 'allow-nan': accept only np.nan values in array. Values cannot
          be infinite.

        For object dtyped data, only np.nan is checked and not np.inf.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``force_all_finite`` accepts the string ``'allow-nan'``.

    ensure_2d : boolean (default=True)
        Whether to raise a value error if array is not 2D.

    allow_nd : boolean (default=False)
        Whether to allow array.ndim > 2.

    ensure_min_samples : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the array has a minimum number of samples in its first
        axis (rows for a 2D array). Setting to 0 disables this check.

    ensure_min_features : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the 2D array has some minimum number of features
        (columns). The default value of 1 rejects empty datasets.
        This check is only enforced when the input data has effectively 2
        dimensions or is originally 1D and ``ensure_2d`` is True. Setting to 0
        disables this check.

    warn_on_dtype : boolean or None, optional (default=None)
        Raise DataConversionWarning if the dtype of the input data structure
        does not match the requested dtype, causing a memory copy.

        .. deprecated:: 0.21
            ``warn_on_dtype`` is deprecated in version 0.21 and will be
            removed in 0.23.

    estimator : str or estimator instance (default=None)
        If passed, include the name of the estimator in warning messages.

    Returns
    -------
    array_converted : object
        The converted and validated array.

(defn check-consistent-length 
  "Check that all arrays have consistent first dimensions.

    Checks whether all objects in arrays have the same shape or length.

    Parameters

    *arrays : list or tuple of input objects.
        Objects that will be checked for consistent length.

(defn dbscan 
  "Perform DBSCAN clustering from vector array or distance matrix.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <dbscan>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array or sparse (CSR) matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features), or             array of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        A feature array, or array of distances between samples if
        ``metric='precomputed'``.

    eps : float, optional
        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered
        as in the neighborhood of the other. This is not a maximum bound
        on the distances of points within a cluster. This is the most
        important DBSCAN parameter to choose appropriately for your data set
        and distance function.

    min_samples : int, optional
        The number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point
        to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself.

    metric : string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string or callable, it must be one of
        the options allowed by :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances` for
        its metric parameter.
        If metric is \"precomputed\", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square. X may be a sparse matrix, in which case only \"nonzero\"
        elements may be considered neighbors for DBSCAN.

    metric_params : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        The algorithm to be used by the NearestNeighbors module
        to compute pointwise distances and find nearest neighbors.
        See NearestNeighbors module documentation for details.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or cKDTree. This can affect the speed
        of the construction and query, as well as the memory required
        to store the tree. The optimal value depends
        on the nature of the problem.

    p : float, optional
        The power of the Minkowski metric to be used to calculate distance
        between points.

    sample_weight : array, shape (n_samples,), optional
        Weight of each sample, such that a sample with a weight of at least
        ``min_samples`` is by itself a core sample; a sample with negative
        weight may inhibit its eps-neighbor from being core.
        Note that weights are absolute, and default to 1.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    core_samples : array [n_core_samples]
        Indices of core samples.

    labels : array [n_samples]
        Cluster labels for each point.  Noisy samples are given the label -1.

    See also
    --------
    DBSCAN
        An estimator interface for this clustering algorithm.
    OPTICS
        A similar estimator interface clustering at multiple values of eps. Our
        implementation is optimized for memory usage.

    Notes
    -----
    For an example, see :ref:`examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.py
    <sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_dbscan.py>`.

    This implementation bulk-computes all neighborhood queries, which increases
    the memory complexity to O(n.d) where d is the average number of neighbors,
    while original DBSCAN had memory complexity O(n). It may attract a higher
    memory complexity when querying these nearest neighborhoods, depending
    on the ``algorithm``.

    One way to avoid the query complexity is to pre-compute sparse
    neighborhoods in chunks using
    :func:`NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph
    <sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph>` with
    ``mode='distance'``, then using ``metric='precomputed'`` here.

    Another way to reduce memory and computation time is to remove
    (near-)duplicate points and use ``sample_weight`` instead.

    :func:`cluster.optics <sklearn.cluster.optics>` provides a similar
    clustering with lower memory usage.
