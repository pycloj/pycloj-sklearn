(ns sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
  "Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance

    The standard score of a sample `x` is calculated as:

        z = (x - u) / s

    where `u` is the mean of the training samples or zero if `with_mean=False`,
    and `s` is the standard deviation of the training samples or one if
    `with_std=False`.

    Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature by computing
    the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Mean and
    standard deviation are then stored to be used on later data using the
    `transform` method.

    Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many
    machine learning estimators: they might behave badly if the
    individual features do not more or less look like standard normally
    distributed data (e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).

    For instance many elements used in the objective function of
    a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector
    Machines or the L1 and L2 regularizers of linear models) assume that
    all features are centered around 0 and have variance in the same
    order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger
    that others, it might dominate the objective function and make the
    estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.

    This scaler can also be applied to sparse CSR or CSC matrices by passing
    `with_mean=False` to avoid breaking the sparsity structure of the data.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    copy : boolean, optional, default True
        If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.
        This is not guaranteed to always work inplace; e.g. if the data is
        not a NumPy array or scipy.sparse CSR matrix, a copy may still be
        returned.

    with_mean : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.
        This does not work (and will raise an exception) when attempted on
        sparse matrices, because centering them entails building a dense
        matrix which in common use cases is likely to be too large to fit in
        memory.

    with_std : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).

    Attributes
    ----------
    scale_ : ndarray or None, shape (n_features,)
        Per feature relative scaling of the data. This is calculated using
        `np.sqrt(var_)`. Equal to ``None`` when ``with_std=False``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *scale_*

    mean_ : ndarray or None, shape (n_features,)
        The mean value for each feature in the training set.
        Equal to ``None`` when ``with_mean=False``.

    var_ : ndarray or None, shape (n_features,)
        The variance for each feature in the training set. Used to compute
        `scale_`. Equal to ``None`` when ``with_std=False``.

    n_samples_seen_ : int or array, shape (n_features,)
        The number of samples processed by the estimator for each feature.
        If there are not missing samples, the ``n_samples_seen`` will be an
        integer, otherwise it will be an array.
        Will be reset on new calls to fit, but increments across
        ``partial_fit`` calls.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    >>> data = [[0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1]]
    >>> scaler = StandardScaler()
    >>> print(scaler.fit(data))
    StandardScaler(copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True)
    >>> print(scaler.mean_)
    [0.5 0.5]
    >>> print(scaler.transform(data))
    [[-1. -1.]
     [-1. -1.]
     [ 1.  1.]
     [ 1.  1.]]
    >>> print(scaler.transform([[2, 2]]))
    [[3. 3.]]

        Further removes the linear correlation across features with 'whiten=True'.

    Notes
    -----
    NaNs are treated as missing values: disregarded in fit, and maintained in
    transform.

    We use a biased estimator for the standard deviation, equivalent to
    `numpy.std(x, ddof=0)`. Note that the choice of `ddof` is unlikely to
    affect model performance.
