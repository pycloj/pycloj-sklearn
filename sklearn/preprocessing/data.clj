    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape [n_samples, n_features]
        The data to binarize, element by element.
        scipy.sparse matrices should be in CSR or CSC format to avoid an
        un-necessary copy.

    threshold : float, optional (0.0 by default)

    By default, the input is checked to be a non-empty 2D array containing
    only finite values. If the dtype of the array is object, attempt
    converting to float, raising on failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : object
        Input object to check / convert.

    accept_sparse : string, boolean or list/tuple of strings (default=False)
        String[s] representing allowed sparse matrix formats, such as 'csc',
        'csr', etc. If the input is sparse but not in the allowed format,
        it will be converted to the first listed format. True allows the input
        to be any format. False means that a sparse matrix input will
        raise an error.

    accept_large_sparse : bool (default=True)
        If a CSR, CSC, COO or BSR sparse matrix is supplied and accepted by
        accept_sparse, accept_large_sparse=False will cause it to be accepted
        only if its indices are stored with a 32-bit dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    dtype : string, type, list of types or None (default=\"numeric\")
        Data type of result. If None, the dtype of the input is preserved.
        If \"numeric\", dtype is preserved unless array.dtype is object.
        If dtype is a list of types, conversion on the first type is only
        performed if the dtype of the input is not in the list.

    order : 'F', 'C' or None (default=None)
        Whether an array will be forced to be fortran or c-style.
        When order is None (default), then if copy=False, nothing is ensured
        about the memory layout of the output array; otherwise (copy=True)
        the memory layout of the returned array is kept as close as possible
        to the original array.

    copy : boolean (default=False)
        Whether a forced copy will be triggered. If copy=False, a copy might
        be triggered by a conversion.

    force_all_finite : boolean or 'allow-nan', (default=True)
        Whether to raise an error on np.inf and np.nan in array. The
        possibilities are:

        - True: Force all values of array to be finite.
        - False: accept both np.inf and np.nan in array.
        - 'allow-nan': accept only np.nan values in array. Values cannot
          be infinite.

        For object dtyped data, only np.nan is checked and not np.inf.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``force_all_finite`` accepts the string ``'allow-nan'``.

    ensure_2d : boolean (default=True)
        Whether to raise a value error if array is not 2D.

    allow_nd : boolean (default=False)
        Whether to allow array.ndim > 2.

    ensure_min_samples : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the array has a minimum number of samples in its first
        axis (rows for a 2D array). Setting to 0 disables this check.

    ensure_min_features : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the 2D array has some minimum number of features
        (columns). The default value of 1 rejects empty datasets.
        This check is only enforced when the input data has effectively 2
        dimensions or is originally 1D and ``ensure_2d`` is True. Setting to 0
        disables this check.

    warn_on_dtype : boolean or None, optional (default=None)
        Raise DataConversionWarning if the dtype of the input data structure
        does not match the requested dtype, causing a memory copy.

        .. deprecated:: 0.21
            ``warn_on_dtype`` is deprecated in version 0.21 and will be

    Currently, power_transform supports the Box-Cox transform and the
    Yeo-Johnson transform. The optimal parameter for stabilizing variance and
    minimizing skewness is estimated through maximum likelihood.

    Box-Cox requires input data to be strictly positive, while Yeo-Johnson
    supports both positive or negative data.

(defn quantile-transform 
  "Transform features using quantiles information.

    This method transforms the features to follow a uniform or a normal
    distribution. Therefore, for a given feature, this transformation tends
    to spread out the most frequent values. It also reduces the impact of
    (marginal) outliers: this is therefore a robust preprocessing scheme.

    The transformation is applied on each feature independently. First an
    estimate of the cumulative distribution function of a feature is
    used to map the original values to a uniform distribution. The obtained
    values are then mapped to the desired output distribution using the
    associated quantile function. Features values of new/unseen data that fall
    below or above the fitted range will be mapped to the bounds of the output
    distribution. Note that this transform is non-linear. It may distort linear
    correlations between variables measured at the same scale but renders
    variables measured at different scales more directly comparable.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_transformer>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like, sparse matrix
        The data to transform.

    axis : int, (default=0)
        Axis used to compute the means and standard deviations along. If 0,
        transform each feature, otherwise (if 1) transform each sample.

    n_quantiles : int, optional (default=1000 or n_samples)
        Number of quantiles to be computed. It corresponds to the number
        of landmarks used to discretize the cumulative distribution function.
        If n_quantiles is larger than the number of samples, n_quantiles is set
        to the number of samples as a larger number of quantiles does not give
        a better approximation of the cumulative distribution function
        estimator.

    output_distribution : str, optional (default='uniform')
        Marginal distribution for the transformed data. The choices are
        'uniform' (default) or 'normal'.

    ignore_implicit_zeros : bool, optional (default=False)
        Only applies to sparse matrices. If True, the sparse entries of the
        matrix are discarded to compute the quantile statistics. If False,
        these entries are treated as zeros.

    subsample : int, optional (default=1e5)
        Maximum number of samples used to estimate the quantiles for
        computational efficiency. Note that the subsampling procedure may
        differ for value-identical sparse and dense matrices.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by np.random. Note that this is used by subsampling and smoothing
        noise.

    copy : boolean, optional, (default=\"warn\")
        Set to False to perform inplace transformation and avoid a copy (if the
        input is already a numpy array). If True, a copy of `X` is transformed,
        leaving the original `X` unchanged

        .. deprecated:: 0.21
            The default value of parameter `copy` will be changed from False
            to True in 0.23. The current default of False is being changed to
            make it more consistent with the default `copy` values of other
            functions in :mod:`sklearn.preprocessing.data`. Furthermore, the
            current default of False may have unexpected side effects by
            modifying the value of `X` inplace

    Returns
    -------
    Xt : ndarray or sparse matrix, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The transformed data.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import quantile_transform
    >>> rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
    >>> X = np.sort(rng.normal(loc=0.5, scale=0.25, size=(25, 1)), axis=0)
    >>> quantile_transform(X, n_quantiles=10, random_state=0, copy=True)
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS

(defn robust-scale 
  "Standardize a dataset along any axis

    Center to the median and component wise scale
    according to the interquartile range.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like
        The data to center and scale.

    axis : int (0 by default)
        axis used to compute the medians and IQR along. If 0,
        independently scale each feature, otherwise (if 1) scale
        each sample.

    with_centering : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.

    with_scaling : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).

    quantile_range : tuple (q_min, q_max), 0.0 < q_min < q_max < 100.0
        Default: (25.0, 75.0) = (1st quantile, 3rd quantile) = IQR
        Quantile range used to calculate ``scale_``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18

    copy : boolean, optional, default is True
        set to False to perform inplace row normalization and avoid a
        copy (if the input is already a numpy array or a scipy.sparse
        CSR matrix and if axis is 1).

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation will refuse to center scipy.sparse matrices
    since it would make them non-sparse and would potentially crash the
    program with memory exhaustion problems.

    Instead the caller is expected to either set explicitly
    `with_centering=False` (in that case, only variance scaling will be
    performed on the features of the CSR matrix) or to call `X.toarray()`
    if he/she expects the materialized dense array to fit in memory.

    To avoid memory copy the caller should pass a CSR matrix.

(defn scale 
  "Standardize a dataset along any axis

    Center to the mean and component wise scale to unit variance.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}
        The data to center and scale.

    axis : int (0 by default)
        axis used to compute the means and standard deviations along. If 0,
        independently standardize each feature, otherwise (if 1) standardize
        each sample.

    with_mean : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.

    with_std : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).

    copy : boolean, optional, default True
        set to False to perform inplace row normalization and avoid a
        copy (if the input is already a numpy array or a scipy.sparse
        CSC matrix and if axis is 1).

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation will refuse to center scipy.sparse matrices
    since it would make them non-sparse and would potentially crash the
    program with memory exhaustion problems.

    Instead the caller is expected to either set explicitly
    `with_mean=False` (in that case, only variance scaling will be
    performed on the features of the CSC matrix) or to call `X.toarray()`
    if he/she expects the materialized dense array to fit in memory.

    To avoid memory copy the caller should pass a CSC matrix.

    NaNs are treated as missing values: disregarded to compute the statistics,
    and maintained during the data transformation.

    We use a biased estimator for the standard deviation, equivalent to
    `numpy.std(x, ddof=0)`. Note that the choice of `ddof` is unlikely to
    affect model performance.
