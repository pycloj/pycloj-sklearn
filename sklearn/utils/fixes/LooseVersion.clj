(ns sklearn.utils.fixes.LooseVersion
  "Version numbering for anarchists and software realists.
    Implements the standard interface for version number classes as
    described above.  A version number consists of a series of numbers,
    separated by either periods or strings of letters.  When comparing
    version numbers, the numeric components will be compared
    numerically, and the alphabetic components lexically.  The following
    are all valid version numbers, in no particular order:

        1.5.1
        1.5.2b2
        161
        3.10a
        8.02
        3.4j
        1996.07.12
        3.2.pl0
        3.1.1.6
        2g6
        11g
        0.960923
        2.2beta29
        1.13++
        5.5.kw
        2.0b1pl0

    In fact, there is no such thing as an invalid version number under
    this scheme; the rules for comparison are simple and predictable,
    but may not always give the results you want (for some definition
    of \"want\").
