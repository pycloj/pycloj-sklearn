(ns sklearn.neighbors.ball-tree.NeighborsHeap
  "A max-heap structure to keep track of distances/indices of neighbors

    This implements an efficient pre-allocated set of fixed-size heaps
    for chasing neighbors, holding both an index and a distance.
    When any row of the heap is full, adding an additional point will push
    the furthest point off the heap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_pts : int
        the number of heaps to use
    n_nbrs : int
        the size of each heap.
