(ns sklearn.neighbors.regression.KNeighborsRegressor
  "Regression based on k-nearest neighbors.

    The target is predicted by local interpolation of the targets
    associated of the nearest neighbors in the training set.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, optional (default = 5)
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.

    weights : str or callable
        weight function used in prediction.  Possible values:

        - 'uniform' : uniform weights.  All points in each neighborhood
          are weighted equally.
        - 'distance' : weight points by the inverse of their distance.
          in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a
          greater influence than neighbors which are further away.
        - [callable] : a user-defined function which accepts an
          array of distances, and returns an array of the same shape
          containing the weights.

        Uniform weights are used by default.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree.  This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree.  The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    p : integer, optional (default = 2)
        Power parameter for the Minkowski metric. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric : string or callable, default 'minkowski'
        the distance metric to use for the tree.  The default metric is
        minkowski, and with p=2 is equivalent to the standard Euclidean
        metric. See the documentation of the DistanceMetric class for a
        list of available metrics.

    metric_params : dict, optional (default = None)
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.
        Doesn't affect :meth:`fit` method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> X = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
    >>> y = [0, 0, 1, 1]
    >>> from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
    >>> neigh = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=2)
    >>> neigh.fit(X, y) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    KNeighborsRegressor(...)
    >>> print(neigh.predict([[1.5]]))
    [0.5]

    .. warning::

       Regarding the Nearest Neighbors algorithms, if it is found that two
       neighbors, neighbor `k+1` and `k`, have identical distances but
       different labels, the results will depend on the ordering of the
       training data.

(defn kneighbors 
  "Finds the K-neighbors of a point.
        Returns indices of and distances to the neighbors of each point.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_query, n_features),                 or (n_query, n_indexed) if metric == 'precomputed'
            The query point or points.
            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.

        n_neighbors : int
            Number of neighbors to get (default is the value
            passed to the constructor).

        return_distance : boolean, optional. Defaults to True.
            If False, distances will not be returned

        Returns
        -------
        dist : array
            Array representing the lengths to points, only present if
            return_distance=True

        ind : array
            Indices of the nearest points in the population matrix.

        Examples
        --------
        In the following example, we construct a NeighborsClassifier
        class from an array representing our data set and ask who's
        the closest point to [1,1,1]

        >>> samples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]
        >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
        >>> neigh = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
        >>> neigh.fit(samples) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        NearestNeighbors(algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, ...)
        >>> print(neigh.kneighbors([[1., 1., 1.]])) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        (array([[0.5]]), array([[2]]))

        As you can see, it returns [[0.5]], and [[2]], which means that the
        element is at distance 0.5 and is the third element of samples
        (indexes start at 0). You can also query for multiple points:

        >>> X = [[0., 1., 0.], [1., 0., 1.]]
        >>> neigh.kneighbors(X, return_distance=False) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        array([[1],
               [2]]...)

(defn kneighbors-graph 
  "Computes the (weighted) graph of k-Neighbors for points in X

        Parameters

        X : array-like, shape (n_query, n_features),                 or (n_query, n_indexed) if metric == 'precomputed'
            The query point or points.
            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.

        n_neighbors : int
            Number of neighbors for each sample.
            (default is value passed to the constructor).

        mode : {'connectivity', 'distance'}, optional
            Type of returned matrix: 'connectivity' will return the
            connectivity matrix with ones and zeros, in 'distance' the
            edges are Euclidean distance between points.

        Returns
        -------
        A : sparse matrix in CSR format, shape = [n_samples, n_samples_fit]
            n_samples_fit is the number of samples in the fitted data
            A[i, j] is assigned the weight of edge that connects i to j.

(defn score 
  "Returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction.

        The coefficient R^2 is defined as (1 - u/v), where u is the residual
        sum of squares ((y_true - y_pred) ** 2).sum() and v is the total
        sum of squares ((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum().
        The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the
        model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always
        predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features,
        would get a R^2 score of 0.0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)
            Test samples. For some estimators this may be a
            precomputed kernel matrix instead, shape = (n_samples,
            n_samples_fitted], where n_samples_fitted is the number of
            samples used in the fitting for the estimator.

        y : array-like, shape = (n_samples) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
            True values for X.

        sample_weight : array-like, shape = [n_samples], optional
            Sample weights.

        Returns
        -------
        score : float
            R^2 of self.predict(X) wrt. y.

        Notes
        -----
        The R2 score used when calling ``score`` on a regressor will use
        ``multioutput='uniform_average'`` from version 0.23 to keep consistent
        with `metrics.r2_score`. This will influence the ``score`` method of
        all the multioutput regressors (except for
        `multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor`). To specify the default value
        manually and avoid the warning, please either call `metrics.r2_score`
        directly or make a custom scorer with `metrics.make_scorer` (the
        built-in scorer ``'r2'`` uses ``multioutput='uniform_average'``).
