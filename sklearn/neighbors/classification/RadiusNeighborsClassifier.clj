(ns sklearn.neighbors.classification.RadiusNeighborsClassifier
  "Classifier implementing a vote among neighbors within a given radius

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <classification>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radius : float, optional (default = 1.0)
        Range of parameter space to use by default for :meth:`radius_neighbors`
        queries.

    weights : str or callable
        weight function used in prediction.  Possible values:

        - 'uniform' : uniform weights.  All points in each neighborhood
          are weighted equally.
        - 'distance' : weight points by the inverse of their distance.
          in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a
          greater influence than neighbors which are further away.
        - [callable] : a user-defined function which accepts an
          array of distances, and returns an array of the same shape
          containing the weights.

        Uniform weights are used by default.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree.  This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree.  The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    p : integer, optional (default = 2)
        Power parameter for the Minkowski metric. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric : string or callable, default 'minkowski'
        the distance metric to use for the tree.  The default metric is
        minkowski, and with p=2 is equivalent to the standard Euclidean
        metric. See the documentation of the DistanceMetric class for a
        list of available metrics.

    outlier_label : int, optional (default = None)
        Label, which is given for outlier samples (samples with no
        neighbors on given radius).
        If set to None, ValueError is raised, when outlier is detected.

    metric_params : dict, optional (default = None)
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> X = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
    >>> y = [0, 0, 1, 1]
    >>> from sklearn.neighbors import RadiusNeighborsClassifier
    >>> neigh = RadiusNeighborsClassifier(radius=1.0)
    >>> neigh.fit(X, y) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    RadiusNeighborsClassifier(...)
    >>> print(neigh.predict([[1.5]]))
    [0]

(defn radius-neighbors 
  "Finds the neighbors within a given radius of a point or points.

        Return the indices and distances of each point from the dataset
        lying in a ball with size ``radius`` around the points of the query
        array. Points lying on the boundary are included in the results.

        The result points are *not* necessarily sorted by distance to their
        query point.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, (n_samples, n_features), optional
            The query point or points.
            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.

        radius : float
            Limiting distance of neighbors to return.
            (default is the value passed to the constructor).

        return_distance : boolean, optional. Defaults to True.
            If False, distances will not be returned

        Returns
        -------
        dist : array, shape (n_samples,) of arrays
            Array representing the distances to each point, only present if
            return_distance=True. The distance values are computed according
            to the ``metric`` constructor parameter.

        ind : array, shape (n_samples,) of arrays
            An array of arrays of indices of the approximate nearest points
            from the population matrix that lie within a ball of size
            ``radius`` around the query points.

        Examples
        --------
        In the following example, we construct a NeighborsClassifier
        class from an array representing our data set and ask who's
        the closest point to [1, 1, 1]:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> samples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]
        >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
        >>> neigh = NearestNeighbors(radius=1.6)
        >>> neigh.fit(samples) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        NearestNeighbors(algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, ...)
        >>> rng = neigh.radius_neighbors([[1., 1., 1.]])
        >>> print(np.asarray(rng[0][0])) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        [1.5 0.5]
        >>> print(np.asarray(rng[1][0])) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        [1 2]

        The first array returned contains the distances to all points which
        are closer than 1.6, while the second array returned contains their
        indices.  In general, multiple points can be queried at the same time.

        Notes
        -----
        Because the number of neighbors of each point is not necessarily
        equal, the results for multiple query points cannot be fit in a
        standard data array.
        For efficiency, `radius_neighbors` returns arrays of objects, where
        each object is a 1D array of indices or distances.

        ----------
        X : array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_features], optional
            The query point or points.
