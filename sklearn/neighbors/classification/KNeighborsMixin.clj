(defn kneighbors 
  "Finds the K-neighbors of a point.
        Returns indices of and distances to the neighbors of each point.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_query, n_features),                 or (n_query, n_indexed) if metric == 'precomputed'
            The query point or points.
            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.

        n_neighbors : int
            Number of neighbors to get (default is the value
            passed to the constructor).

        return_distance : boolean, optional. Defaults to True.
            If False, distances will not be returned

        Returns
        -------
        dist : array
            Array representing the lengths to points, only present if
            return_distance=True

        ind : array
            Indices of the nearest points in the population matrix.

        Examples
        --------
        In the following example, we construct a NeighborsClassifier
        class from an array representing our data set and ask who's
        the closest point to [1,1,1]

        >>> samples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]
        >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
        >>> neigh = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
        >>> neigh.fit(samples) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        NearestNeighbors(algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, ...)
        >>> print(neigh.kneighbors([[1., 1., 1.]])) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        (array([[0.5]]), array([[2]]))

        As you can see, it returns [[0.5]], and [[2]], which means that the
        element is at distance 0.5 and is the third element of samples
        (indexes start at 0). You can also query for multiple points:

        >>> X = [[0., 1., 0.], [1., 0., 1.]]
        >>> neigh.kneighbors(X, return_distance=False) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        array([[1],
               [2]]...)

        "
  [self X n_neighbors & {:keys [return_distance]
                       :or {return_distance true}} ]
    (py/call-attr-kw self "kneighbors" [X n_neighbors] {:return_distance return_distance }))

(defn kneighbors-graph 
  "Computes the (weighted) graph of k-Neighbors for points in X

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_query, n_features),                 or (n_query, n_indexed) if metric == 'precomputed'
            The query point or points.
            If not provided, neighbors of each indexed point are returned.
            In this case, the query point is not considered its own neighbor.

        n_neighbors : int
            Number of neighbors for each sample.
            (default is value passed to the constructor).

        mode : {'connectivity', 'distance'}, optional
            Type of returned matrix: 'connectivity' will return the
            connectivity matrix with ones and zeros, in 'distance' the
            edges are Euclidean distance between points.

        Returns
        -------
        A : sparse matrix in CSR format, shape = [n_samples, n_samples_fit]
            n_samples_fit is the number of samples in the fitted data
            A[i, j] is assigned the weight of edge that connects i to j.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> X = [[0], [3], [1]]
        >>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
        >>> neigh = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2)
        >>> neigh.fit(X) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        NearestNeighbors(algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, ...)
        >>> A = neigh.kneighbors_graph(X)
        >>> A.toarray()
        array([[1., 0., 1.],
               [0., 1., 1.],
               [1., 0., 1.]])
