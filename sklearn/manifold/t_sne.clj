(defn check-array 
  "Input validation on an array, list, sparse matrix or similar.

    By default, the input is checked to be a non-empty 2D array containing
    only finite values. If the dtype of the array is object, attempt
    converting to float, raising on failure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : object
        Input object to check / convert.

    accept_sparse : string, boolean or list/tuple of strings (default=False)
        String[s] representing allowed sparse matrix formats, such as 'csc',
        'csr', etc. If the input is sparse but not in the allowed format,
        it will be converted to the first listed format. True allows the input
        to be any format. False means that a sparse matrix input will
        raise an error.

    accept_large_sparse : bool (default=True)
        If a CSR, CSC, COO or BSR sparse matrix is supplied and accepted by
        accept_sparse, accept_large_sparse=False will cause it to be accepted
        only if its indices are stored with a 32-bit dtype.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    dtype : string, type, list of types or None (default=\"numeric\")
        Data type of result. If None, the dtype of the input is preserved.
        If \"numeric\", dtype is preserved unless array.dtype is object.
        If dtype is a list of types, conversion on the first type is only
        performed if the dtype of the input is not in the list.

    order : 'F', 'C' or None (default=None)
        Whether an array will be forced to be fortran or c-style.
        When order is None (default), then if copy=False, nothing is ensured
        about the memory layout of the output array; otherwise (copy=True)
        the memory layout of the returned array is kept as close as possible
        to the original array.

    copy : boolean (default=False)
        Whether a forced copy will be triggered. If copy=False, a copy might
        be triggered by a conversion.

    force_all_finite : boolean or 'allow-nan', (default=True)
        Whether to raise an error on np.inf and np.nan in array. The
        possibilities are:

        - True: Force all values of array to be finite.
        - False: accept both np.inf and np.nan in array.
        - 'allow-nan': accept only np.nan values in array. Values cannot
          be infinite.

        For object dtyped data, only np.nan is checked and not np.inf.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
           ``force_all_finite`` accepts the string ``'allow-nan'``.

    ensure_2d : boolean (default=True)
        Whether to raise a value error if array is not 2D.

    allow_nd : boolean (default=False)
        Whether to allow array.ndim > 2.

    ensure_min_samples : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the array has a minimum number of samples in its first
        axis (rows for a 2D array). Setting to 0 disables this check.

    ensure_min_features : int (default=1)
        Make sure that the 2D array has some minimum number of features
        (columns). The default value of 1 rejects empty datasets.
        This check is only enforced when the input data has effectively 2
        dimensions or is originally 1D and ``ensure_2d`` is True. Setting to 0
        disables this check.

    warn_on_dtype : boolean or None, optional (default=None)
        Raise DataConversionWarning if the dtype of the input data structure
        does not match the requested dtype, causing a memory copy.

        .. deprecated:: 0.21
            ``warn_on_dtype`` is deprecated in version 0.21 and will be
            removed in 0.23.

    estimator : str or estimator instance (default=None)
        If passed, include the name of the estimator in warning messages.

(defn pairwise-distances 
  " Compute the distance matrix from a vector array X and optional Y.

    This method takes either a vector array or a distance matrix, and returns
    a distance matrix. If the input is a vector array, the distances are
    computed. If the input is a distances matrix, it is returned instead.

    This method provides a safe way to take a distance matrix as input, while
    preserving compatibility with many other algorithms that take a vector
    array.

    If Y is given (default is None), then the returned matrix is the pairwise
    distance between the arrays from both X and Y.

    Valid values for metric are:

    - From scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',
      'manhattan']. These metrics support sparse matrix inputs.

    - From scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',
      'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski', 'mahalanobis',
      'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao', 'seuclidean',
      'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean', 'yule']
      See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these
      metrics. These metrics do not support sparse matrix inputs.

    Note that in the case of 'cityblock', 'cosine' and 'euclidean' (which are
    valid scipy.spatial.distance metrics), the scikit-learn implementation
    will be used, which is faster and has support for sparse matrices (except
    for 'cityblock'). For a verbose description of the metrics from
    scikit-learn, see the __doc__ of the sklearn.pairwise.distance_metrics
    function.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array [n_samples_a, n_samples_a] if metric == \"precomputed\", or,              [n_samples_a, n_features] otherwise
        Array of pairwise distances between samples, or a feature array.

    Y : array [n_samples_b, n_features], optional
        An optional second feature array. Only allowed if
        metric != \"precomputed\".

    metric : string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the options
        allowed by scipy.spatial.distance.pdist for its metric parameter, or
        a metric listed in pairwise.PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS.
        If metric is \"precomputed\", X is assumed to be a distance matrix.
        Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays from X as input and return a value indicating
        the distance between them.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by breaking
        down the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing them in
        parallel.

        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    **kwds : optional keyword parameters
        Any further parameters are passed directly to the distance function.
        If using a scipy.spatial.distance metric, the parameters are still
        metric dependent. See the scipy docs for usage examples.

    Returns
    -------
    D : array [n_samples_a, n_samples_a] or [n_samples_a, n_samples_b]
        A distance matrix D such that D_{i, j} is the distance between the
        ith and jth vectors of the given matrix X, if Y is None.
        If Y is not None, then D_{i, j} is the distance between the ith array
        from X and the jth array from Y.

    The following are common calling conventions.

    1. ``Y = pdist(X, 'euclidean')``

       Computes the distance between m points using Euclidean distance
       (2-norm) as the distance metric between the points. The points
       are arranged as m n-dimensional row vectors in the matrix X.

    2. ``Y = pdist(X, 'minkowski', p=2.)``

       Computes the distances using the Minkowski distance
       :math:`||u-v||_p` (p-norm) where :math:`p \geq 1`.

    3. ``Y = pdist(X, 'cityblock')``

       Computes the city block or Manhattan distance between the
       points.

    4. ``Y = pdist(X, 'seuclidean', V=None)``

       Computes the standardized Euclidean distance. The standardized
       Euclidean distance between two n-vectors ``u`` and ``v`` is

       .. math::

          \sqrt{\sum {(u_i-v_i)^2 / V[x_i]}}


       V is the variance vector; V[i] is the variance computed over all
       the i'th components of the points.  If not passed, it is
       automatically computed.

    5. ``Y = pdist(X, 'sqeuclidean')``

       Computes the squared Euclidean distance :math:`||u-v||_2^2` between
       the vectors.

    6. ``Y = pdist(X, 'cosine')``

       Computes the cosine distance between vectors u and v,

       .. math::

          1 - \frac{u \cdot v}
                   {{||u||}_2 {||v||}_2}

       where :math:`||*||_2` is the 2-norm of its argument ``*``, and
       :math:`u \cdot v` is the dot product of ``u`` and ``v``.

    7. ``Y = pdist(X, 'correlation')``

       Computes the correlation distance between vectors u and v. This is

       .. math::

          1 - \frac{(u - \bar{u}) \cdot (v - \bar{v})}
                   {{||(u - \bar{u})||}_2 {||(v - \bar{v})||}_2}

       where :math:`\bar{v}` is the mean of the elements of vector v,
       and :math:`x \cdot y` is the dot product of :math:`x` and :math:`y`.

    8. ``Y = pdist(X, 'hamming')``

       Computes the normalized Hamming distance, or the proportion of
       those vector elements between two n-vectors ``u`` and ``v``
       which disagree. To save memory, the matrix ``X`` can be of type
       boolean.

    9. ``Y = pdist(X, 'jaccard')``

       Computes the Jaccard distance between the points. Given two
       vectors, ``u`` and ``v``, the Jaccard distance is the
       proportion of those elements ``u[i]`` and ``v[i]`` that
       disagree.

    10. ``Y = pdist(X, 'chebyshev')``

       Computes the Chebyshev distance between the points. The
       Chebyshev distance between two n-vectors ``u`` and ``v`` is the
       maximum norm-1 distance between their respective elements. More
       precisely, the distance is given by

       .. math::

          d(u,v) = \max_i {|u_i-v_i|}

    11. ``Y = pdist(X, 'canberra')``

       Computes the Canberra distance between the points. The
       Canberra distance between two points ``u`` and ``v`` is

       .. math::

         d(u,v) = \sum_i \frac{|u_i-v_i|}
                              {|u_i|+|v_i|}


    12. ``Y = pdist(X, 'braycurtis')``

       Computes the Bray-Curtis distance between the points. The
       Bray-Curtis distance between two points ``u`` and ``v`` is


       .. math::

            d(u,v) = \frac{\sum_i {|u_i-v_i|}}
                           {\sum_i {|u_i+v_i|}}

    13. ``Y = pdist(X, 'mahalanobis', VI=None)``

       Computes the Mahalanobis distance between the points. The
       Mahalanobis distance between two points ``u`` and ``v`` is
       :math:`\sqrt{(u-v)(1/V)(u-v)^T}` where :math:`(1/V)` (the ``VI``
       variable) is the inverse covariance. If ``VI`` is not None,
       ``VI`` will be used as the inverse covariance matrix.

    14. ``Y = pdist(X, 'yule')``

       Computes the Yule distance between each pair of boolean
       vectors. (see yule function documentation)

    15. ``Y = pdist(X, 'matching')``

       Synonym for 'hamming'.

    16. ``Y = pdist(X, 'dice')``

       Computes the Dice distance between each pair of boolean
       vectors. (see dice function documentation)

    17. ``Y = pdist(X, 'kulsinski')``

       Computes the Kulsinski distance between each pair of
       boolean vectors. (see kulsinski function documentation)

    18. ``Y = pdist(X, 'rogerstanimoto')``

       Computes the Rogers-Tanimoto distance between each pair of
       boolean vectors. (see rogerstanimoto function documentation)

    19. ``Y = pdist(X, 'russellrao')``

       Computes the Russell-Rao distance between each pair of
       boolean vectors. (see russellrao function documentation)

    20. ``Y = pdist(X, 'sokalmichener')``

       Computes the Sokal-Michener distance between each pair of
       boolean vectors. (see sokalmichener function documentation)

    21. ``Y = pdist(X, 'sokalsneath')``

       Computes the Sokal-Sneath distance between each pair of
       boolean vectors. (see sokalsneath function documentation)

    22. ``Y = pdist(X, 'wminkowski', p=2, w=w)``

       Computes the weighted Minkowski distance between each pair of
       vectors. (see wminkowski function documentation)

    23. ``Y = pdist(X, f)``

       Computes the distance between all pairs of vectors in X
       using the user supplied 2-arity function f. For example,
       Euclidean distance between the vectors could be computed
       as follows::

         dm = pdist(X, lambda u, v: np.sqrt(((u-v)**2).sum()))

       Note that you should avoid passing a reference to one of
       the distance functions defined in this library. For example,::

         dm = pdist(X, sokalsneath)

       would calculate the pair-wise distances between the vectors in
       X using the Python function sokalsneath. This would result in
       sokalsneath being called :math:`{n \choose 2}` times, which
       is inefficient. Instead, the optimized C version is more
       efficient, and we call it using the following syntax.::

         dm = pdist(X, 'sokalsneath')

(defn squareform 
  "
    Convert a vector-form distance vector to a square-form distance
    matrix, and vice-versa.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : ndarray
        Either a condensed or redundant distance matrix.
    force : str, optional
        As with MATLAB(TM), if force is equal to ``'tovector'`` or
        ``'tomatrix'``, the input will be treated as a distance matrix or
        distance vector respectively.
    checks : bool, optional
        If set to False, no checks will be made for matrix
        symmetry nor zero diagonals. This is useful if it is known that
        ``X - X.T1`` is small and ``diag(X)`` is close to zero.
        These values are ignored any way so they do not disrupt the
        squareform transformation.

    Returns
    -------
    Y : ndarray
        If a condensed distance matrix is passed, a redundant one is
        returned, or if a redundant one is passed, a condensed distance
        matrix is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    1. v = squareform(X)

       Given a square d-by-d symmetric distance matrix X,
       ``v = squareform(X)`` returns a ``d * (d-1) / 2`` (or
       :math:`{n \choose 2}`) sized vector v.

      :math:`v[{n \choose 2}-{n-i \choose 2} + (j-i-1)]` is the distance
      between points i and j. If X is non-square or asymmetric, an error
      is returned.

    2. X = squareform(v)

      Given a ``d*(d-1)/2`` sized v for some integer ``d >= 2`` encoding
      distances as described, ``X = squareform(v)`` returns a d by d distance
      matrix X.  The ``X[i, j]`` and ``X[j, i]`` values are set to
      :math:`v[{n \choose 2}-{n-i \choose 2} + (j-i-1)]` and all
      diagonal elements are zero.

    In SciPy 0.19.0, ``squareform`` stopped casting all input types to
    float64, and started returning arrays of the same dtype as the input.

    neighbors in the output space, and every sample j is its :math:`r(i, j)`-th

        Which metric to use for computing pairwise distances between samples
        from the original input space. If metric is 'precomputed', X must be a
        matrix of pairwise distances or squared distances. Otherwise, see the
        documentation of argument metric in sklearn.pairwise.pairwise_distances
        for a list of available metrics.

    trustworthiness : float
        Trustworthiness of the low-dimensional embedding.
