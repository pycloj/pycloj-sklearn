  "Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts

    This implementation produces a sparse representation of the counts using
    scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.

    If you do not provide an a-priori dictionary and you do not use an analyzer
    that does some kind of feature selection then the number of features will
    be equal to the vocabulary size found by analyzing the data.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <text_feature_extraction>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : string {'filename', 'file', 'content'}
        If 'filename', the sequence passed as an argument to fit is
        expected to be a list of filenames that need reading to fetch
        the raw content to analyze.

        If 'file', the sequence items must have a 'read' method (file-like
        object) that is called to fetch the bytes in memory.

        Otherwise the input is expected to be the sequence strings or
        bytes items are expected to be analyzed directly.

    encoding : string, 'utf-8' by default.
        If bytes or files are given to analyze, this encoding is used to
        decode.

    decode_error : {'strict', 'ignore', 'replace'}
        Instruction on what to do if a byte sequence is given to analyze that
        contains characters not of the given `encoding`. By default, it is
        'strict', meaning that a UnicodeDecodeError will be raised. Other
        values are 'ignore' and 'replace'.

    strip_accents : {'ascii', 'unicode', None}
        Remove accents and perform other character normalization
        during the preprocessing step.
        'ascii' is a fast method that only works on characters that have
        an direct ASCII mapping.
        'unicode' is a slightly slower method that works on any characters.
        None (default) does nothing.

        Both 'ascii' and 'unicode' use NFKD normalization from
        :func:`unicodedata.normalize`.

    lowercase : boolean, True by default
        Convert all characters to lowercase before tokenizing.

    preprocessor : callable or None (default)
        Override the preprocessing (string transformation) stage while
        preserving the tokenizing and n-grams generation steps.

    tokenizer : callable or None (default)
        Override the string tokenization step while preserving the
        preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.

    stop_words : string {'english'}, list, or None (default)
        If 'english', a built-in stop word list for English is used.
        There are several known issues with 'english' and you should
        consider an alternative (see :ref:`stop_words`).

        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which
        will be removed from the resulting tokens.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.

        If None, no stop words will be used. max_df can be set to a value
        in the range [0.7, 1.0) to automatically detect and filter stop
        words based on intra corpus document frequency of terms.

    token_pattern : string
        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a \"token\", only used
        if ``analyzer == 'word'``. The default regexp select tokens of 2
        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored
        and always treated as a token separator).

    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n)
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
        will be used.

    analyzer : string, {'word', 'char', 'char_wb'} or callable
        Whether the feature should be made of word or character n-grams.
        Option 'char_wb' creates character n-grams only from text inside
        word boundaries; n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.

        If a callable is passed it is used to extract the sequence of features
        out of the raw, unprocessed input.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.21
        Since v0.21, if ``input`` is ``filename`` or ``file``, the data is
        first read from the file and then passed to the given callable
        analyzer.

    max_df : float in range [0.0, 1.0] or int, default=1.0
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly higher than the given threshold (corpus-specific
        stop words).
        If float, the parameter represents a proportion of documents, integer
        absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    min_df : float in range [0.0, 1.0] or int, default=1
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly lower than the given threshold. This value is also
        called cut-off in the literature.
        If float, the parameter represents a proportion of documents, integer
        absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    max_features : int or None, default=None
        If not None, build a vocabulary that only consider the top
        max_features ordered by term frequency across the corpus.

        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    vocabulary : Mapping or iterable, optional
        Either a Mapping (e.g., a dict) where keys are terms and values are
        indices in the feature matrix, or an iterable over terms. If not
        given, a vocabulary is determined from the input documents. Indices
        in the mapping should not be repeated and should not have any gap
        between 0 and the largest index.

    binary : boolean, default=False
        If True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete
        probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer
        counts.

    dtype : type, optional
        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().

    Attributes
    ----------
    vocabulary_ : dict
        A mapping of terms to feature indices.

    stop_words_ : set
        Terms that were ignored because they either:

          - occurred in too many documents (`max_df`)
          - occurred in too few documents (`min_df`)
          - were cut off by feature selection (`max_features`).

        This is only available if no vocabulary was given.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
    >>> corpus = [
    ...     'This is the first document.',
    ...     'This document is the second document.',
    ...     'And this is the third one.',
    ...     'Is this the first document?',
    ... ]
    >>> vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    >>> X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
    >>> print(vectorizer.get_feature_names())
    ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']
    >>> print(X.toarray())  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [[0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1]
     [0 2 0 1 0 1 1 0 1]
     [1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1]
     [0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1]]
