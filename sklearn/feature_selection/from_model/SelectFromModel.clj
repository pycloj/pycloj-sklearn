(ns sklearn.feature-selection.from-model.SelectFromModel
  "Meta-transformer for selecting features based on importance weights.

    .. versionadded:: 0.17

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        The base estimator from which the transformer is built.
        This can be both a fitted (if ``prefit`` is set to True)
        or a non-fitted estimator. The estimator must have either a
        ``feature_importances_`` or ``coef_`` attribute after fitting.

    threshold : string, float, optional default None
        The threshold value to use for feature selection. Features whose
        importance is greater or equal are kept while the others are
        discarded. If \"median\" (resp. \"mean\"), then the ``threshold`` value is
        the median (resp. the mean) of the feature importances. A scaling
        factor (e.g., \"1.25*mean\") may also be used. If None and if the
        estimator has a parameter penalty set to l1, either explicitly
        or implicitly (e.g, Lasso), the threshold used is 1e-5.
        Otherwise, \"mean\" is used by default.

    prefit : bool, default False
        Whether a prefit model is expected to be passed into the constructor
        directly or not. If True, ``transform`` must be called directly
        and SelectFromModel cannot be used with ``cross_val_score``,
        ``GridSearchCV`` and similar utilities that clone the estimator.
        Otherwise train the model using ``fit`` and then ``transform`` to do
        feature selection.

    norm_order : non-zero int, inf, -inf, default 1
        Order of the norm used to filter the vectors of coefficients below
        ``threshold`` in the case where the ``coef_`` attribute of the
        estimator is of dimension 2.

    max_features : int or None, optional
        The maximum number of features selected scoring above ``threshold``.
        To disable ``threshold`` and only select based on ``max_features``,
        set ``threshold=-np.inf``.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimator_ : an estimator
        The base estimator from which the transformer is built.
        This is stored only when a non-fitted estimator is passed to the
        ``SelectFromModel``, i.e when prefit is False.

    threshold_ : float
        The threshold value used for feature selection.
