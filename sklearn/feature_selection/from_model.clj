  "Constructs a new estimator with the same parameters.

    Clone does a deep copy of the model in an estimator
    without actually copying attached data. It yields a new estimator
    with the same parameters that has not been fit on any data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object, or list, tuple or set of objects
        The estimator or group of estimators to be cloned

    safe : boolean, optional
        If safe is false, clone will fall back to a deep copy on objects
        that are not estimators.

    sub-estimator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delegate : string, list of strings or tuple of strings
        Name of the sub-estimator that can be accessed as an attribute of the
        base object. If a list or a tuple of names are provided, the first
        sub-estimator that is an attribute of the base object will be used.
