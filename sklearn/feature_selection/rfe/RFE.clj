  "Feature ranking with recursive feature elimination.

    Given an external estimator that assigns weights to features (e.g., the
    coefficients of a linear model), the goal of recursive feature elimination
    (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller
    sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of
    features and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a
    ``coef_`` attribute or through a ``feature_importances_`` attribute.
    Then, the least important features are pruned from current set of features.
    That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired
    number of features to select is eventually reached.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <rfe>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        A supervised learning estimator with a ``fit`` method that provides
        information about feature importance either through a ``coef_``
        attribute or through a ``feature_importances_`` attribute.

    n_features_to_select : int or None (default=None)
        The number of features to select. If `None`, half of the features
        are selected.

    step : int or float, optional (default=1)
        If greater than or equal to 1, then ``step`` corresponds to the
        (integer) number of features to remove at each iteration.
        If within (0.0, 1.0), then ``step`` corresponds to the percentage
        (rounded down) of features to remove at each iteration.

    verbose : int, (default=0)
        Controls verbosity of output.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_ : int
        The number of selected features.

    support_ : array of shape [n_features]
        The mask of selected features.

    ranking_ : array of shape [n_features]
        The feature ranking, such that ``ranking_[i]`` corresponds to the
        ranking position of the i-th feature. Selected (i.e., estimated
        best) features are assigned rank 1.

    estimator_ : object
        The external estimator fit on the reduced dataset.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example shows how to retrieve the 5 right informative
    features in the Friedman #1 dataset.

    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_friedman1
    >>> from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
    >>> from sklearn.svm import SVR
    >>> X, y = make_friedman1(n_samples=50, n_features=10, random_state=0)
    >>> estimator = SVR(kernel=\"linear\")
    >>> selector = RFE(estimator, 5, step=1)
    >>> selector = selector.fit(X, y)
    >>> selector.support_ # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True, False, False, False, False,
           False])
    >>> selector.ranking_
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 4, 3, 2, 5])
