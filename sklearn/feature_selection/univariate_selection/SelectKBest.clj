(ns sklearn.feature-selection.univariate-selection.SelectKBest
  "Select features according to the k highest scores.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score_func : callable
        Function taking two arrays X and y, and returning a pair of arrays
        (scores, pvalues) or a single array with scores.
        Default is f_classif (see below \"See also\"). The default function only
        works with classification tasks.

    k : int or \"all\", optional, default=10
        Number of top features to select.
        The \"all\" option bypasses selection, for use in a parameter search.

    Attributes
    ----------
    scores_ : array-like, shape=(n_features,)
        Scores of features.

    pvalues_ : array-like, shape=(n_features,)
        p-values of feature scores, None if `score_func` returned only scores.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
    >>> from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2
    >>> X, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)
    >>> X.shape
    (1797, 64)
    >>> X_new = SelectKBest(chi2, k=20).fit_transform(X, y)
    >>> X_new.shape
    (1797, 20)

    Notes
    -----
    Ties between features with equal scores will be broken in an unspecified
    way.
