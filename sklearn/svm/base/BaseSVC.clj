        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)

        Returns
        -------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_classes * (n_classes-1) / 2)
            Returns the decision function of the sample for each class
            in the model.
            If decision_function_shape='ovr', the shape is (n_samples,
            n_classes).

        Notes
        -----
        If decision_function_shape='ovo', the function values are proportional
        to the distance of the samples X to the separating hyperplane. If the
        exact distances are required, divide the function values by the norm of
        the weight vector (``coef_``). See also `this question
        <https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/14876/
        interpreting-distance-from-hyperplane-in-svm>`_ for further details.
        If decision_function_shape='ovr', the decision function is a monotonic
        transformation of ovo decision function.

  "Fit the SVM model according to the given training data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            Training vectors, where n_samples is the number of samples
            and n_features is the number of features.
            For kernel=\"precomputed\", the expected shape of X is
            (n_samples, n_samples).

        y : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            Target values (class labels in classification, real numbers in
            regression)

        sample_weight : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
            Per-sample weights. Rescale C per sample. Higher weights
            force the classifier to put more emphasis on these points.

        Notes
        -----
        If X and y are not C-ordered and contiguous arrays of np.float64 and

        Parameters
        ----------

            For kernel=\"precomputed\", the expected shape of X is

        The probability model is created using cross validation, so
