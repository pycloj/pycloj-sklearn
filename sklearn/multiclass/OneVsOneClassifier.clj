(ns sklearn.multiclass.OneVsOneClassifier
  "One-vs-one multiclass strategy

    This strategy consists in fitting one classifier per class pair.
    At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected.
    Since it requires to fit `n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2` classifiers,
    this method is usually slower than one-vs-the-rest, due to its
    O(n_classes^2) complexity. However, this method may be advantageous for
    algorithms such as kernel algorithms which don't scale well with
    `n_samples`. This is because each individual learning problem only involves
    a small subset of the data whereas, with one-vs-the-rest, the complete
    dataset is used `n_classes` times.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <ovo_classification>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object
        An estimator object implementing `fit` and one of `decision_function`
        or `predict_proba`.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to use for the computation.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of ``n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2`` estimators
        Estimators used for predictions.

    classes_ : numpy array of shape [n_classes]
        Array containing labels.

    pairwise_indices_ : list, length = ``len(estimators_)``, or ``None``
        Indices of samples used when training the estimators.
        ``None`` when ``estimator`` does not have ``_pairwise`` attribute.

        The decision values for the samples are computed by adding the
        normalized sum of pair-wise classification confidence levels to the

        votes for all the classes are equal leading to a tie.

        Should be used when memory is inefficient to train all data. Chunks

        ----------

            Can be obtained via `np.unique(y_all)`, where y_all is the
            target vector of the entire dataset.
            This argument is only required in the first call of partial_fit
